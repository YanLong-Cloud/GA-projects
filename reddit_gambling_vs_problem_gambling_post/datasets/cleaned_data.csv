7,0,"Screaming Links Question...So I had a very weird experience on two bonus teases I have never seen before. I was playing the Zhao Ci variant at my local casino, and as per usual got the four ball tease with center ball flying by. What was interesting was that even though I didn't land it, the medium bonus ball went by. The second time I got a tease, the Large bonus ball went by. In the center spot. Which is impossible. 

Now the reason this perplexed me, was that supposedly (at least as far as I know) it is impossible for this to land in the center spot on the board. For those that don't play, those named balls are the progressives, and the center ball is the multiplier space. But there it was, twice. As a tease. 

To clarify this was an older variant, not a new dual center space variant where it supposedly is possible to land a progressive there. 

So my question to anyone who has played this more than me is, is it possible to land a progressive in the center? If so, is it possible to multiply it. 

And if not, why in God's name tease it?

Appreciate any info I can get."

26,0,"BlackjackToday I started with 10 euro in Blackjack and ended up with 1000 euros. I lost 400 euros the other day, and I am a poor student so that was not good. I decided to stop. An today I tried just 10 euro more. And got lucky. Was at 700 at a point and then I started playing with my emotions I went as low as 300 euros again. But I made it back up to a 1000 and luckily i stopped. This was a good day. But it's important to stop. I think I will stop gambling for a while now and enjoy my money. 

When I lost the 400 euros I was really sad and depressed for a few days and that's not good. Gambling should be fun. And you can loose your head fast. So remember to take brakes. You (and I) Will probably loose in the long run so enjoy yourself. And stop before it goes to far."

28,0,"California Taxes are a Bitchjust filed today. I finished the year down about $5k. But because I had many taxables - and in CA taxables count toward your adjusted GROSS income - I have to pay a few thousand in additional tax. This is *after* deducting my losses. My accountant warned me about this last year, but I didn't listen (because I like to gamble). Seeing how much I actually have to fucking pay, despite finishing the year DOWN, makes me sick. I guess I'm going to have to adjust my play to stay below the taxable limit, or play tables and do the math my way. Fuck

Don't ask me to explain it. I don't fully understand how it works, but I hire a real CPA so its legit. It's something like ""the taxable wins count toward your overall income bracket"" which determines how much tax you pay."

30,0,"Bovada Asking for Bank StatementsSo, yesterday, I received an email notifying me that my account had been suspended. I emailed customer service listed on the website, and they asked me to call their phone number, which I also verified on the website.

Customer service said a deposit had been reversed back in Nov., and I now owe them $250. While on the phone, I looked up the bank account in question from Nov. through today, and I had not received any money back at any point (from anyone). 

The woman told me I'd have to submit my bank statements from Nov. through the current date to resolve the issue to prove I hadn't received money back from the transaction. I told her under no circumstances would I provide them full bank statements. She then said they would send my account to a third party collection agency and it would hurt my credit. I told her if those are the only two options, I'd take the latter. I have a credit score over 800 and will fight it all the way. 

Am I crazy to think that submitting entire bank statements to a foreign company is completely unacceptable? I really am not scared by their threat, but I do wonder if anyone else has dealt with this before. I spend a ton of money on their website every football season, so it seems odd they'd do this to a loyal customer."

41,0,"My Game Idea: GeoPolitical SimulatorThis took me about 6 hours total to brainstorm, write, revise. I created it for a bachelor party/vacation happening in 2 months. It can be setup with just pen and paper. I'm planning to involve real money. Any number of players can play. I didn't look up whether any similar games are out there because this was not made for commercialization purposes. My favorite part about this game, the reason I thought it's worth sharing, is that it's both simple and realistic, which makes it easy and fun, but you can also learn something. Looking forward to any reactions or advice, so I am X-posting here, although I already posted on r/boardgames

2 resources available: 1 / Time. 2 / Money. Everyone starts with 100 Time and 100 Money. If Time goes to 0, player is out and cannot communicate in any way with the remaining players.

I am planning to give real money as a prize, proportional to how much game money you end the game with. Another option is to let players start with different amounts of money depending on buy in amount.

2 actions that can be made at any time: 1 / Make law. 2 / Enforce law.

Laws can be made at anytime. Your laws can say whatever you want. You can write them down, or you can state them verbally. Your laws can also be used to trade Time and Money resources with other players. To finalize the time and money exchange that you made in your law, the involved parties can simultaneously enforce/allow the law, and the time and money are instantly remitted.

If an Enforce Law action is not coming from a mutual agreement between two parties, the Enforcement Phase begins. There is a continuous time decay rate of 1 Time per minute that the enforcement phase goes on, for all those players involved in the enforcement phase, which is the enforcer and the enforcee(s). The enforcer is responsible for keeping track of the time decay. Enforcer cannot enforce again on the same player until end of Enforcement Phase to cause more Time decay, but enforcer can alter the law that is being enforced.

2 actions that can be made by enforcee(s): 1 / Resist Law. 2 / Allow Law

After someone enforces law, enforcee can choose to resist law or allow law. If enforcee allows law, the enforcement phase ends instantly and all the contents of the law are enacted. The law could be something like, ""The Establishment of a New Country Named Happy Land"", which doesn't really help/hurt anyone, so it's unlikely to need to be enforced or resisted. Or it can be something like ""All players will pay a $10 tax to me"", which deducts prize money from the enforcees.

If enforcee resists law, enforcement phase continues. Time Decay is continuously subtracted during enforcement phase, but the time deductions caused by the following actions are only subtracted at the end of the enforcement phase.

Enforcer chooses to either 1 / Attack or 2 / Retreat.

If enforcer retreats, enforcement phase ends, and the law is not enforced on enforcee.

If enforcer decides to attack, enforcer chooses an amount of time to subtract from the enforcee, and that amount multiplied by 5/4 is subtracted from Enforcer. Once attack time is chosen, it cannot be changed and attack action is over. After enforcer decides on the Attack Time, the total elapsed time decay from the start of the enforcement phase to present is checked. If the enforcement phase time decay is greater than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase ends, the law is not enforced, and the attack time deduction is deducted. If the enforcement phase time decay is lower than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase continues.

Next, Enforcee may choose to do a Retaliate action. If the enforcement phase time decay becomes equal to the Attack Time at any point before the end of retaliation, the law is not enforced, and the respective attack action time deductions are deducted.

For a Retaliate Action, the Enforcee chooses an amount of time less than or equal to the amount that the Enforcer chose during the Attack action, and that amount is subtracted equally from both the enforcer and the enforcee. Once a retaliate action time deduction is chosen, it is final, and the enforcement phase is over.

Enforcement phase and the resulting continuous time decay can only end after Enforcee chooses their retaliation action. After the retaliation action is chosen, which is the end of the enforcement phase, time is deducted in the order of Attack Action time loss and then Retaliation Action time loss. Enforcement phase time decay ceases.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 Time, enforcee only gets time deduction equal to 4/5 of enforcer time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement fails and enforcee can choose to automatically make and enforce any law on enforcer and enforcer is out, so enforcer cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 time, but the enforcee time deduction is equal to enforcer time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 Time, enforcer only gets time deduction equal to 5/4 of enforcee time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement is successful and law can be revised by enforcer before final enforcement and enforcee is out, so enforcee cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 time, but the enforcer time deduction is equal to enforcee time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

The beautiful thing about this game is that you might never have to enter an enforcement phase and go through all the resultant complexity. The game has a chance of just being a role playing game of making funny, nonsensical, or inconsequential laws that have mutual agreement and never have to be enforced. But when real money is involved, you might want to use the enforcement phase to settle conflicts. The enforcement phase is the most difficult to understand and play, but it is not meant to be the central part of the game. The game is supposed to be about imagining that you are a GeoPolitical figure/country and how you might interact with the other figures.

If you've read this far, you are far too kind. Thanks for your patience. Look forward to reading any ideas you have."

Every couple months I put money on William hill to bet on sports. I (always despite my better judgement) end up playing blackjack and losing it all in 15 minutes. Cycle repeats every few months. Stupid of me to even go near it. I usually only play 30 hands give or take, and it always leads to an unreal losing streak. I really do think their blackjack is rigged.  The last 3 times I've played for example,  I have had 15 losses in 16 hands, the next time I put money on, a 7 hand losing streak, now again another 7 game losing streak, mixed with other bs in only 21 hands.  And I am pretty much playing it by the book. So my question: is this just outrageously bad luck or is something likely rotten in the state of Denmark?  

I could see this happening once, maybe twice, but 3 times in a row, call me skeptical.

or am I just bitter and that is how it goes?

Following the rules, you should hit again, right? But I‚Äôve always felt uneasy about that since if you just got two low cards, chances are the next card will be a higher card. But I know that that only really applies when there‚Äôs a set number of decks. In online blackjack, aren‚Äôt there unlimited cards, so those odds don‚Äôt really apply?

My question is, in a situation in online BJ where you flip over a bunch of low cards, do the odds still say that you should hit again hoping for a low card? Or is there actually a higher chance of getting a high card, and you should stand?"

But I'm curious about potential comps along the way. I know you should never play specifically for comps and never expect anything. But I enjoy the hunt and the game for trying to maximize it. If I play a lot, but spaced out across Caesars properties, does that give worse comps than concentrating my play at one property, even if it's a slightly lower amount?

For example, video poker is one of my favorite games. At the level I want to play, Cromwell has better pay tables than Harrah's. Hypothetically, for a session, if I was gonna play $300-400 coin in Cromwell and nothing else, or $200-300 at Harrah's but plenty of table game play, which is better?

Basically, is it better to have a home base casino or is it all good as long as it's in the Caesars umbrella?"

* Divide bankroll into $100/day
* Cashout any winnings over $X and stop playing when losses are down by $X (say +/- $30 in this scenario)

Would it be better to spend all that free play first, with bare minimum of cash to participate (say $10), and cash any winnings as pure profit, OR try to divide that $400 across the 4-5 days virtually in my head, so once I am $100 down on freeplay, play the rest of it with my actual cash and don't activate the freeplay.

199,0,"Mobile App Slot Machine Jackpot Inquiry 

Hey Guys, so this is pretty embarrassing, but I have a very specific question, I'm hoping someone might have some advice or knowledge about it.

So to pass time, I play this stupid mobile slot machine game called Double Win. You get free ""coins"" every so often that you can use to play the slot machines. You can also buy coins with real money for a price.

The cost for these fake coins is roughly $100 for 2,250,000,000 coins.

I've been playing this off and on for many months, maybe even over a year off and on, just something to do for a few minutes when I get free coins, and then I stop when I'm out of coins and wait until I receive the next bonus.

I recently hit a major jackpot on one of the slots and won 1,424,286,075,157 coins.

If you do the math, the amount of coins I have is worth $66,301 in real money if you were to buy that same amount of coins from the applications store.

I'm wondering if there is a way I can sell my account to someone at a major discount to make some money. It looks like there is a User ID tied to my account.

I'd bet that there's someone that would want a trillion coins for the game at a major discount.

Any ideas or thoughts?

Players can partake in games like Death Rolls, Blackjack and Roulette with the help of the in-game random number generator. (Numbers are generated by typing /roll followed by the number.  A coin flip is ""/roll 2"". A dice roll is ""/roll 6"". Most games are played with /roll 100.) 

Death Rolls - A player (usually the house) will start with a /roll 100. The opponent will then /roll the result of the previous roll. This process goes back and forth, getting smaller and smaller, until a player rolls a 1 and loses.

An example might look like this: 

A. /roll 100 = 83
B. /roll 83   = 42
A. /roll 42   = 13
B. /roll 13   = 7
A. /roll 7     = 1

High/Low - Each player will /roll 100. The player with the highest result wins the game. Ties are re-rolled.

Roulette - A player makes bets and receives payouts exactly like in the real world Roulette. The house will /roll 38. 37 is 0 and 38 is 00.

Blackjack - The rules are the same as in normal Blackjack, but there's no splitting. Using a /roll 13, the house gets 1 number and the player gets two. 1 = Ace. 2-10 = given value. 11-13 = 10 . The player then has to Hit, Stand, or Double. (Surrender may or may not be available depending on the Casino) The house then does a /roll 13 to get their second card, add up the value and continue to ""draw"" cards until they hit 17 or bust.

Lucky 100 - The player will /roll 100. If the number is 1-60, the player loses. If the number is 61-97, the player wins double their wager. If the number is 98, 99, or 100, you win triple. 

There are numerous versions of Lucky 100. The numbers and payouts tend to vary slightly depending on which casino you go to. 

Do any of these games have +EV? I have a small nest egg saved that I'd like to grow in a fun way.

Sports Betting legalization across USA is obviously huge, as I think younger Americans generally find sports betting and apps like DraftKings much more engaging and affordable than classic casino games. 

I also think within the next 5-10 years we could see more popular video games that incorporate gambling in some way. We already kinda have this with microtransactions/loot boxes, but I think eventually some games could directly implement gambling features. For example, 100 people bet $1 on a Fortnite style free for all game and the winner gets $100?

By my calculations:

You place a bet for ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, if it wins you get ¬£110 (¬£10 profit). You lay a bet on the same outcome, ¬£105 at odds of 1 (EVEN)

If the horse wins, you win ¬£110 from the bet, but lose the lay bet, paying ¬£105. Profit = ¬£5

If the horse loses, you keep the lay bet of ¬£105, but lost the ¬£100 bet. Profit = ¬£5

&amp;#x200B;

If you enter this into any of the online calculators, it says that if you are betting ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, then you should lay ¬£110 at odds of 1 to guarantee ¬£10 profit. Surely they are not taking into account the fact that if the horse wins, you would have made ¬£10 profit from the bet getting ¬£110 back, but that you would have also paid out ¬£110 for the lay bet.

All of a sudden my brother and his hard partying friends drag me along to Vegas as part of a package deal or something. 

We started on video roulette with a live wheel since none of us had been to a real casino before, and I decided to go with a strategy of putting $5 on green, $5 each on 0/00 and $15 on red/black. So either lose $30, break even, or win $250. What I really liked was how many roulette games have a stat board with the last 20-30 game results, so we looked for tables that hadn't hit green in a while and then went in on 0 and 00.

So I end up winning $470 off 2 greens (0 and 00) in quick succession and decide to hit the real table. I put $20 on 0/00 and $50 on green for my first spin, the other guys at the table laugh, and whaddya know it fucking hit double zero!!! $1600 profit on one spin... Everyone went crazy and I tipped the dealer $50. 

I quickly cashed out and bought my mom a nice Christmas present, but ended up playing some more roulette, briefly tried blackjack &amp; craps as well. Even though I only ended up with about $200 in profit it was totally worth it for 2 days of roulette.

It has became  so popular, that many other companies have copied that bonus format  &amp; applied it to their games whenever someone wins it's bonus &amp; have produced many copycats of it. The  question is, how many of them are there in which their bonus games have  played **exactly** like it?"

Just wanted to get some input on how frequently you all gamble. I for myself am gambling for about 1 year and I REALLY enjoy it (doesnt matter if I lose or win). Also do you go alone to a casino? I have only been about 3 times alone but it felt really weird as I am used to go to casinos with friends. Also how far are casinos from your hometown? In Austria for example are a total of 12 casinos with 2 of them being about 30-40 minutes away by car from my place(my regular places)."

I mean it was x20 in the end, but I did have several losing sessions. But it seemed 'fair'.

Since then, due to withdrawal limits and pending shit and my own greed I did the whole lot back apart from 5k. It just seemed completely different. On the roulette, I'm betting on 52% (also betting on zero) and I was losing 4 spins out of 5. The slots were completely dead.

I was in contact with the 'VIP manager' (I'm a VIP at this small casino lol). He kept saying how he would try and get the withdrawals expedited, which further fuels reversing all those batches of withdrawals.

398,0,"Vegas tripWe just got back from Vegas so I thought I'd give you guys a little report.

We played blackjack downtown at El Cortez. Really good tables with $10 minimums. You can count it easy enough but don't overstay your welcome or they'll back you off. I typically will count for 1 hour and then leave and have never had a problem. El Cortez had a large bucket filled with ice and beer right by the tables so beer drink service is good.

We played Pai Gow downtown at Golden Nugget. The jackpot is a $1 bet and it's over 500k right now. It's a $15 minimum table. Drink service is slower than El Cortez but not horrible.

Craps and Pai Gow tiles we played at Bellagio. $25 tables. We got destroyed at craps quickly but played for hours at tiles and broke even. Drink service is excellent at Bellagio. 

We played roulette at Cromwell. They have a $25 minimum single zero roulette which is the cheapest single zero I could find. Didn't drink here.  They also look like they had playable blackjack but I didn't have time.

Vegas tip:. If you're going to a strip club, call the club and have them pick you up with their shuttle. You'll get free entry and save the Uber ride. Otherwise, they charge $50 a piece to get in (yes, even for the women)."

403,0,"Who just got beat by that last play of the Falcons-49ers game?Might as well explain for those who didn't see it.

Over-Under of the Falcons-49ers game was 48 points. 49ers lead 22-17 with 10 seconds left (39 points).

Falcons score a touchdown with 2 seconds left to take the lead 23-22. They elect not to kick the extra point and just kneel down to prevent any potential blocked kick return (45 points, still under 48).

Falcons still have to kick back to the 49ers for one final play. 49ers take the kick, and start frantically passing the ball backwards to each other to keep the play alive in hopes of scoring. However, the 49ers fumble on the 3 yard line, the Falcons recover, and fall into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game. 29-22, with the total now 51.

TL;DR: Falcons score 12 points in 2 seconds, 6 of them meaningless, changing the betting result from Under to Over 48 points."

I expect to be able to visit the casino two days (with about 16 hours total) during my stay. As far as I understand I play against the minimum house edge with blackjack and 9/6 jacks or better video poker. However, the minimum bet at blackjack tables is 25 USD, while the maximum amount I am comfortable losing during my two days of casino attendance is 150 ‚Äì 200 USD (1 USD equals to about 6 units of my local currency).

410,0,"The .00001% unicorn finally happened for me. $25 into $9000 at Bovegas online casinoI just felt like sharing with someone.. I've been gambling for 18 years (the bodog and poker era) and about a week ago I saw an ad for Bovegas accepting USA players online.  I normally gamble in the local casinos (we have many here) and decided to give it a go.  Used the welcome bonus with no cash out restriction to boost my $25 amount to a little under a $100, with 30x playthrough and only able to play slots.  Played Santastic, Shark School ,Cash Bandits 2 and a few spins of Count Spectacular.  Last night when i went to bed I had a little over $9,000. My comp points show I have done about $40,000 of play through.

Essentially, I hit the progressive on Santastic twice in 1 night (.50 cent bet) and was able to grind my way through the roughly $3600 play through, ending up with something around $700.  After the entire amount (minus the bonus portion they deduct) became unlocked and the money was unrestricted, I increased my stakes gradually and also added in craps doing Pass Line with Come bets and got particularly lucky along with higher stakes slots on my 3 favorites listed above... Literally a heater, I was getting bonus round after bonus, increasing my stakes eventually to $5/$6 per spin.

Craps on RTG is highly volatile and you will never go more than 10-15 spins before a 7 out.  Anywho, after grinding about 20 hours over a week over these games I have now won the most I've ever won.  (Previous high was Dover Downs in Delaware, $7000 playing Craps and Blackjack and hitting the side bet bonuses).

I have already submitted my verification documentation 3 days ago (they ask for many things) and awaiting approval, which says typically 4 business days.  They have a maximum cashout of $2000 per week with a 7 business day period processing for each one and also have a stipulation in their T&amp;C that they reserve the right to pay in installments, so I might be collecting for several months (by reading some of the reviews on Bovegas).  I'm hopeful they will pay out my winnings without too much resistance.

Three years ago. i was winning approx 1000-2000 monthly..now I lose 2000 weekly. I am more experienced, see more into the sport but somehow, all sports have become so much unpredictable that it is impossible to do win.
Out of desperation I bet 1.04 100 euro, because I just wanted to win something. Ended up 2:0 to 2:2 in last five minutes in football...just...unimaginable how my luck works..

Currently at 36 loses in a row, can't hit anything...just minutes ago I lost bet where I bet on set, my player had 7 setballs, 5:3 40:0, then 5:4 40:15. Then tiebreak 6:6 5:1 lost 5:7...just...annoying..

It comes to the point where I think that I actually decide by placing bet who is gonna lose...so if I place two bets. Players would just keep.playing forever probably, lol.

478,0,"Screaming Links Question...So I had a very weird experience on two bonus teases I have never seen before. I was playing the Zhao Ci variant at my local casino, and as per usual got the four ball tease with center ball flying by. What was interesting was that even though I didn't land it, the medium bonus ball went by. The second time I got a tease, the Large bonus ball went by. In the center spot. Which is impossible. 

Now the reason this perplexed me, was that supposedly (at least as far as I know) it is impossible for this to land in the center spot on the board. For those that don't play, those named balls are the progressives, and the center ball is the multiplier space. But there it was, twice. As a tease. 

To clarify this was an older variant, not a new dual center space variant where it supposedly is possible to land a progressive there. 

So my question to anyone who has played this more than me is, is it possible to land a progressive in the center? If so, is it possible to multiply it. 

And if not, why in God's name tease it?

My accountant warned me about this last year, but I didn't listen (because I like to gamble). Seeing how much I actually have to fucking pay, despite finishing the year DOWN, makes me sick. I guess I'm going to have to adjust my play to stay below the taxable limit, or play tables and do the math my way. Fuck

485,0,"Bovada Asking for Bank StatementsSo, yesterday, I received an email notifying me that my account had been suspended. I emailed customer service listed on the website, and they asked me to call their phone number, which I also verified on the website.

Customer service said a deposit had been reversed back in Nov., and I now owe them $250. While on the phone, I looked up the bank account in question from Nov. through today, and I had not received any money back at any point (from anyone). 

The woman told me I'd have to submit my bank statements from Nov. through the current date to resolve the issue to prove I hadn't received money back from the transaction. I told her under no circumstances would I provide them full bank statements. She then said they would send my account to a third party collection agency and it would hurt my credit. I told her if those are the only two options, I'd take the latter. I have a credit score over 800 and will fight it all the way. 

Am I crazy to think that submitting entire bank statements to a foreign company is completely unacceptable?

487,0,"My Game Idea: GeoPolitical SimulatorThis took me about 6 hours total to brainstorm, write, revise. I created it for a bachelor party/vacation happening in 2 months. It can be setup with just pen and paper. I'm planning to involve real money. Any number of players can play. I didn't look up whether any similar games are out there because this was not made for commercialization purposes. My favorite part about this game, the reason I thought it's worth sharing, is that it's both simple and realistic, which makes it easy and fun, but you can also learn something. Looking forward to any reactions or advice, so I am X-posting here, although I already posted on r/boardgames

2 resources available: 1 / Time. 2 / Money. Everyone starts with 100 Time and 100 Money. If Time goes to 0, player is out and cannot communicate in any way with the remaining players.

I am planning to give real money as a prize, proportional to how much game money you end the game with. Another option is to let players start with different amounts of money depending on buy in amount.

2 actions that can be made at any time: 1 / Make law. 2 / Enforce law.

Laws can be made at anytime. Your laws can say whatever you want. You can write them down, or you can state them verbally. Your laws can also be used to trade Time and Money resources with other players. To finalize the time and money exchange that you made in your law, the involved parties can simultaneously enforce/allow the law, and the time and money are instantly remitted.

If an Enforce Law action is not coming from a mutual agreement between two parties, the Enforcement Phase begins. There is a continuous time decay rate of 1 Time per minute that the enforcement phase goes on, for all those players involved in the enforcement phase, which is the enforcer and the enforcee(s). The enforcer is responsible for keeping track of the time decay. Enforcer cannot enforce again on the same player until end of Enforcement Phase to cause more Time decay, but enforcer can alter the law that is being enforced.

2 actions that can be made by enforcee(s): 1 / Resist Law. 2 / Allow Law

After someone enforces law, enforcee can choose to resist law or allow law. If enforcee allows law, the enforcement phase ends instantly and all the contents of the law are enacted. The law could be something like, ""The Establishment of a New Country Named Happy Land"", which doesn't really help/hurt anyone, so it's unlikely to need to be enforced or resisted. Or it can be something like ""All players will pay a $10 tax to me"", which deducts prize money from the enforcees.

If enforcee resists law, enforcement phase continues. Time Decay is continuously subtracted during enforcement phase, but the time deductions caused by the following actions are only subtracted at the end of the enforcement phase.

Enforcer chooses to either 1 / Attack or 2 / Retreat.

If enforcer retreats, enforcement phase ends, and the law is not enforced on enforcee.

If enforcer decides to attack, enforcer chooses an amount of time to subtract from the enforcee, and that amount multiplied by 5/4 is subtracted from Enforcer. Once attack time is chosen, it cannot be changed and attack action is over. After enforcer decides on the Attack Time, the total elapsed time decay from the start of the enforcement phase to present is checked. If the enforcement phase time decay is greater than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase ends, the law is not enforced, and the attack time deduction is deducted. If the enforcement phase time decay is lower than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase continues.

Next, Enforcee may choose to do a Retaliate action. If the enforcement phase time decay becomes equal to the Attack Time at any point before the end of retaliation, the law is not enforced, and the respective attack action time deductions are deducted.

For a Retaliate Action, the Enforcee chooses an amount of time less than or equal to the amount that the Enforcer chose during the Attack action, and that amount is subtracted equally from both the enforcer and the enforcee. Once a retaliate action time deduction is chosen, it is final, and the enforcement phase is over.

Enforcement phase and the resulting continuous time decay can only end after Enforcee chooses their retaliation action. After the retaliation action is chosen, which is the end of the enforcement phase, time is deducted in the order of Attack Action time loss and then Retaliation Action time loss. Enforcement phase time decay ceases.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 Time, enforcee only gets time deduction equal to 4/5 of enforcer time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement fails and enforcee can choose to automatically make and enforce any law on enforcer and enforcer is out, so enforcer cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 time, but the enforcee time deduction is equal to enforcer time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 Time, enforcer only gets time deduction equal to 5/4 of enforcee time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement is successful and law can be revised by enforcer before final enforcement and enforcee is out, so enforcee cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 time, but the enforcer time deduction is equal to enforcee time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

The beautiful thing about this game is that you might never have to enter an enforcement phase and go through all the resultant complexity. The game has a chance of just being a role playing game of making funny, nonsensical, or inconsequential laws that have mutual agreement and never have to be enforced. But when real money is involved, you might want to use the enforcement phase to settle conflicts. The enforcement phase is the most difficult to understand and play, but it is not meant to be the central part of the game. The game is supposed to be about imagining that you are a GeoPolitical figure/country and how you might interact with the other figures.

Every couple months I put money on William hill to bet on sports. I (always despite my better judgement) end up playing blackjack and losing it all in 15 minutes. Cycle repeats every few months. Stupid of me to even go near it. I usually only play 30 hands give or take, and it always leads to an unreal losing streak. I really do think their blackjack is rigged.  The last 3 times I've played for example,  I have had 15 losses in 16 hands, the next time I put money on, a 7 hand losing streak, now again another 7 game losing streak, mixed with other bs in only 21 hands.  And I am pretty much playing it by the book. So my question: is this just outrageously bad luck or is something likely rotten in the state of Denmark?  

I could see this happening once, maybe twice, but 3 times in a row, call me skeptical.

or am I just bitter and that is how it goes?

That makes perfect sense, but what if the dealer has a 7, and you have a 12. You hit once, get a two, hit again, and get another two, you now have 16. Following the rules, you should hit again, right? But I‚Äôve always felt uneasy about that since if you just got two low cards, chances are the next card will be a higher card. But I know that that only really applies when there‚Äôs a set number of decks. In online blackjack, aren‚Äôt there unlimited cards, so those odds don‚Äôt really apply?

But I'm curious about potential comps along the way. I know you should never play specifically for comps and never expect anything. But I enjoy the hunt and the game for trying to maximize it. If I play a lot, but spaced out across Caesars properties, does that give worse comps than concentrating my play at one property, even if it's a slightly lower amount?

For example, video poker is one of my favorite games. At the level I want to play, Cromwell has better pay tables than Harrah's. Hypothetically, for a session, if I was gonna play $300-400 coin in Cromwell and nothing else, or $200-300 at Harrah's but plenty of table game play, which is better?

513,0,"P&amp;L, Bankroll Management, and FrequencyI‚Äôm curious to get a discussion going about what your typical numbers are when it comes to profit &amp; loss, bankroll management, and frequency of gambling.

I‚Äôve had a good start to the year - 3 jackpots from 3 separate casinos totaling ~$4,500.

* $1250 on $5x5credit/hand Jacks or Better (1H)
* $2000 on $1x5credit/hand Super Times Double Double Bonus (3H)
* $1500 on $12.50/spin (50¬¢ denom, 25 credits) LightningLink Lucky Lanterns

Also won &amp; lost a few thousand in between. Total out ahead is ~$2k right now (was 3, gave back $1k last night... damn major!)

I typically bankroll $500-$1k on an average trip, with 2-3 trips per month, and I take home ~50% of my profits for the night.


What does your trip record typically look like, and how many trips do you make per month?"
514,0,"Tax Season BallersIt's tax season in the United States. (I don't know how other countries tax systems work) 

For any non Americans - When you file your taxes, it's all calculated to see how much you paid in taxes vs how much was owed by you. (It's based on your income, which tax bracket you fall into, any investments, assets, dependents (kids), businesses, etc)  There's more to it than that but usually if you paid more than what was owed by you, then you qualify for a return of that money. It's not unusual to see someone get a tax return of a couple thousand dollars. 

I went to the local casino on a Wednesday night and couldn't find a damn seat **ANYWHERE** in the place. I could only chalk it up to everybody getting their tax returns and wanting to double that money. More power to them but for the year-round degenerate gamblers, this is exactly how January feels for people who go to the gym year round. Just a bunch of random new faces showing up and taking up all the spots haha just my two cents on the subject. What do you all think? Anyone else put aside some of that tax return money to just gamble recklessly with it?"
515,0,"How would you adjust your cashing out strategy in slots with Freeplay?I have an upcoming trip where I will have $400 in Freeplay and bringing $500 for 5 days in Vegas (4 nights and most of a fifth day).  Without the freeplay, I would play the slots with something like:

* Divide bankroll into $100/day
* Cashout any winnings over $X and stop playing when losses are down by $X (say +/- $30 in this scenario)

Would it be better to spend all that free play first, with bare minimum of cash to participate (say $10), and cash any winnings as pure profit, OR try to divide that $400 across the 4-5 days virtually in my head, so once I am $100 down on freeplay, play the rest of it with my actual cash and don't activate the freeplay.

EDIT: it was suggested in a previous post to spend all that freeplay in a high limit room or with video poker, and maybe treat it as a separate bankroll from my actual money."

I looked at the entrance and I saw a bunch of names posted on what look like court documents notifying people that they had hearings coming up where the casino was seeking the bar them from entering any properties.

520,0,"Mobile App Slot Machine Jackpot Inquiry 

Hey Guys, so this is pretty embarrassing, but I have a very specific question, I'm hoping someone might have some advice or knowledge about it.

So to pass time, I play this stupid mobile slot machine game called Double Win. You get free ""coins"" every so often that you can use to play the slot machines. You can also buy coins with real money for a price.

The cost for these fake coins is roughly $100 for 2,250,000,000 coins.

I've been playing this off and on for many months, maybe even over a year off and on, just something to do for a few minutes when I get free coins, and then I stop when I'm out of coins and wait until I receive the next bonus.

I recently hit a major jackpot on one of the slots and won 1,424,286,075,157 coins.

If you do the math, the amount of coins I have is worth $66,301 in real money if you were to buy that same amount of coins from the applications store.

I'm wondering if there is a way I can sell my account to someone at a major discount to make some money. It looks like there is a User ID tied to my account.

I'd bet that there's someone that would want a trillion coins for the game at a major discount.

Any ideas or thoughts?

524,0,"gambling in WoW ClassicGambling in World of Warcraft used to be against the ToS, but now independent player casinos operate free from impunity. 

Players can partake in games like Death Rolls, Blackjack and Roulette with the help of the in-game random number generator. (Numbers are generated by typing /roll followed by the number.  A coin flip is ""/roll 2"". A dice roll is ""/roll 6"". Most games are played with /roll 100.) 

Death Rolls - A player (usually the house) will start with a /roll 100. The opponent will then /roll the result of the previous roll. This process goes back and forth, getting smaller and smaller, until a player rolls a 1 and loses.

An example might look like this: 

A. /roll 100 = 83
B. /roll 83   = 42
A. /roll 42   = 13
B. /roll 13   = 7
A. /roll 7     = 1

High/Low - Each player will /roll 100. The player with the highest result wins the game. Ties are re-rolled.

Roulette - A player makes bets and receives payouts exactly like in the real world Roulette. The house will /roll 38. 37 is 0 and 38 is 00.

Blackjack - The rules are the same as in normal Blackjack, but there's no splitting. Using a /roll 13, the house gets 1 number and the player gets two. 1 = Ace. 2-10 = given value. 11-13 = 10 . The player then has to Hit, Stand, or Double. (Surrender may or may not be available depending on the Casino) The house then does a /roll 13 to get their second card, add up the value and continue to ""draw"" cards until they hit 17 or bust.

Lucky 100 - The player will /roll 100. If the number is 1-60, the player loses. If the number is 61-97, the player wins double their wager. If the number is 98, 99, or 100, you win triple. 

There are numerous versions of Lucky 100. The numbers and payouts tend to vary slightly depending on which casino you go to. 

Do any of these games have +EV? I have a small nest egg saved that I'd like to grow in a fun way.

Sports Betting legalization across USA is obviously huge, as I think younger Americans generally find sports betting and apps like DraftKings much more engaging and affordable than classic casino games. 

I also think within the next 5-10 years we could see more popular video games that incorporate gambling in some way. We already kinda have this with microtransactions/loot boxes, but I think eventually some games could directly implement gambling features. For example, 100 people bet $1 on a Fortnite style free for all game and the winner gets $100?

You place a bet for ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, if it wins you get ¬£110 (¬£10 profit). You lay a bet on the same outcome, ¬£105 at odds of 1 (EVEN)

If the horse wins, you win ¬£110 from the bet, but lose the lay bet, paying ¬£105. Profit = ¬£5

If you enter this into any of the online calculators, it says that if you are betting ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, then you should lay ¬£110 at odds of 1 to guarantee ¬£10 profit. Surely they are not taking into account the fact that if the horse wins, you would have made ¬£10 profit from the bet getting ¬£110 back, but that you would have also paid out ¬£110 for the lay bet.

All of a sudden my brother and his hard partying friends drag me along to Vegas as part of a package deal or something. 

We started on video roulette with a live wheel since none of us had been to a real casino before, and I decided to go with a strategy of putting $5 on green, $5 each on 0/00 and $15 on red/black. So either lose $30, break even, or win $250. What I really liked was how many roulette games have a stat board with the last 20-30 game results, so we looked for tables that hadn't hit green in a while and then went in on 0 and 00.

So I end up winning $470 off 2 greens (0 and 00) in quick succession and decide to hit the real table. I put $20 on 0/00 and $50 on green for my first spin, the other guys at the table laugh, and whaddya know it fucking hit double zero!!! $1600 profit on one spin... Everyone went crazy and I tipped the dealer $50. 

I quickly cashed out and bought my mom a nice Christmas present, but ended up playing some more roulette, briefly tried blackjack &amp; craps as well. Even though I only ended up with about $200 in profit it was totally worth it for 2 days of roulette.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

I was at a BJ table waiting for the pit boss to get me a new players card, he ran off with my ID to do whatever they do. I decided I didn't like that table and got up and walked down towards where the boss with my ID was. He was on the computer with 4-5 other casino employees/dealers around. But the surrounding tables were closed. I noticed another pit boss using what looked like a pick tool poking dice like in the middle of the dots with another man in a suit over his shoulder. He put them back in the silver foil wrapper and walked off.

560,0,"Is there a payout% or does your account get flagged when you win for online casinosI turned about ¬£2k into ¬£40k recently playing online roulette and a few slots in between. I was up and down, mostly due to putting bigger bets on when losing (martingale esque but not formally) and only doing black, even, odd, red and covering zero for psychological aspects. I mean it was x20 in the end, but I did have several losing sessions. But it seemed 'fair'.

Since then, due to withdrawal limits and pending shit and my own greed I did the whole lot back apart from 5k. It just seemed completely different. On the roulette, I'm betting on 52% (also betting on zero) and I was losing 4 spins out of 5. The slots were completely dead.

I was in contact with the 'VIP manager' (I'm a VIP at this small casino lol). He kept saying how he would try and get the withdrawals expedited, which further fuels reversing all those batches of withdrawals.

The pattern was about every 6 months or so I would jump in. But everytime I would lose everything I had by that strong feeling to gain it all back whenever I lose. 

Even though it was never BIG BETS, still, overtime it adds up quite a bit and I decided to lifetime self exclude myself(if possible) from one site. Then I would find another site to play, and I did self excluse myself to pretty much all the major websites of gambling and poker.

I typically will count for 1 hour and then leave and have never had a problem. El Cortez had a large bucket filled with ice and beer right by the tables so beer drink service is good.

We played Pai Gow downtown at Golden Nugget. The jackpot is a $1 bet and it's over 500k right now. It's a $15 minimum table. Drink service is slower than El Cortez but not horrible.

Craps and Pai Gow tiles we played at Bellagio. $25 tables. We got destroyed at craps quickly but played for hours at tiles and broke even. Drink service is excellent at Bellagio. 

We played roulette at Cromwell. They have a $25 minimum single zero roulette which is the cheapest single zero I could find. Didn't drink here.  They also look like they had playable blackjack but I didn't have time.

Over-Under of the Falcons-49ers game was 48 points. 49ers lead 22-17 with 10 seconds left (39 points).

Falcons score a touchdown with 2 seconds left to take the lead 23-22. They elect not to kick the extra point and just kneel down to prevent any potential blocked kick return (45 points, still under 48).

Falcons still have to kick back to the 49ers for one final play. 49ers take the kick, and start frantically passing the ball backwards to each other to keep the play alive in hopes of scoring. However, the 49ers fumble on the 3 yard line, the Falcons recover, and fall into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game. 29-22, with the total now 51.

582,0,"The .00001% unicorn finally happened for me. $25 into $9000 at Bovegas online casinoI just felt like sharing with someone.. I've been gambling for 18 years (the bodog and poker era) and about a week ago I saw an ad for Bovegas accepting USA players online.  I normally gamble in the local casinos (we have many here) and decided to give it a go.  Used the welcome bonus with no cash out restriction to boost my $25 amount to a little under a $100, with 30x playthrough and only able to play slots.  Played Santastic, Shark School ,Cash Bandits 2 and a few spins of Count Spectacular.  Last night when i went to bed I had a little over $9,000. My comp points show I have done about $40,000 of play through.

Essentially, I hit the progressive on Santastic twice in 1 night (.50 cent bet) and was able to grind my way through the roughly $3600 play through, ending up with something around $700.  After the entire amount (minus the bonus portion they deduct) became unlocked and the money was unrestricted, I increased my stakes gradually and also added in craps doing Pass Line with Come bets and got particularly lucky along with higher stakes slots on my 3 favorites listed above... Literally a heater, I was getting bonus round after bonus, increasing my stakes eventually to $5/$6 per spin.

Craps on RTG is highly volatile and you will never go more than 10-15 spins before a 7 out.  Anywho, after grinding about 20 hours over a week over these games I have now won the most I've ever won.  (Previous high was Dover Downs in Delaware, $7000 playing Craps and Blackjack and hitting the side bet bonuses).

I have already submitted my verification documentation 3 days ago (they ask for many things) and awaiting approval, which says typically 4 business days.  They have a maximum cashout of $2000 per week with a 7 business day period processing for each one and also have a stipulation in their T&amp;C that they reserve the right to pay in installments, so I might be collecting for several months (by reading some of the reviews on Bovegas).  I'm hopeful they will pay out my winnings without too much resistance.

It's not like I'm losing, because I play roulette and I usually double my initial bankroll (50‚Ç¨), but I only leave when I lose my profit so I can be like ""I had a great time and didnt lose money)

2,1,"Day 1Lets hope this sticks with me.
For my own sanity, my family and my Girl.
Fuck compulsive gambling and the industry behind it.
All the time lost, the headaches, the empty pockets, the lies will be part of the past.
I already told my Girl and my Mom about it a few weeks ago and only gambled small amounts a few times but i need to stop wasting so much time into this stupid thing. 
Gonna try and find a group at my place like GA.
Also started listening to the after-gambling Podcast.
Stay strong Guys and i hope i can overcome this obstacle in my life .
Peace out and will be here again"
3,1,"Going to my first G.A. meeting TuesdayI maxed out what little I had left on my credit cards from gambling online this week. The last time I gambled was December 2018 on a cruise where I lost about $800 :( I was doing so well until I saw a freaking online casino ad on Facebook and my stupid brain thought ‚Äúlet me try it out!‚Äù Mistakes were made but my mom is coming with me to an open meeting for moral support. Sorry for the brain dump, I‚Äôm new to this subreddit and I‚Äôm hoping I can find some resources and support here. Only a few people who are close to me know about my addiction."
4,1,"How to stay positive and motivated when not gambling?I see it as a drug, which when you don't take( gamble) sucks the soul out of you. Its like you are never happy without it, but when you win, Ure happy and high for a while...followed by sorrow for days and months when you lose. 


I had a long day of  talk one on one with myself in the mirror and finally convinced my mind that I am destroying myself in the present and this will become future soon. Accepting all my losses as lesson( too big amount to count)

Amounts I owe to loans:
$2500

Money I have saved:
$0


I will have amounts paid to the loans at the end of the month from paychecks and savings will start again. 

I will keep feeding my mind that any wins from gambling will only be future losses and depression for days and months, ruining my present.


What else can I do to stay motivated and productive to not think of losses , gambling etc?


I have 0 friends, family or gf right now. Lost them all to gambling addiction last year when i turned super negative from losses.

I'm not worried or concerned about them anymore, as I just want happiness for myself and others here, which are hurt from this addiction. Here is a virtual hug for you! It will be okay, stay positive ,even during your darkest time."
5,1,"Day 14day 14 baby, just 2 weeks ago I was in a really dark place"
6,1,"Day 35 - Feeling on edge!It's been somewhat of a rough week.  Had an interview earlier in the week, which I thought went well, but I didn't get the job. It's been a long couple of years looking for work in my field and I have to push myself hard not to give up.  I can't afford to stop.  I HAVE to find work and very soon.As usual, the disappointment sent me on my ""I wish I could gamble"" route.  Gambling has always been my ultimate escape.  I got through it, but tonight, I feel very on edge.  If I had the means, I definitely would gamble.  But I don't and so I won't. 

But I find it so disheartening in these early stages to constantly battle the urge. Perhaps it's because another week is starting and I have nowhere to go, perhaps it's the Sunday blues ... who knows, but I wish I could just forget about gambling and continue my life in peace.

Since the beginning of January, I have forced myself to be productive every day - searching for jobs, cleaning the house, cooking wholesome food, exercising, etc.  I track these things religiously and even though I don't do everything every day, I feel better for being productive and moving forward instead of staying stuck.  But tonight, the urge to gamble has invaded my brain and it's not letting up.  I've listened to podcasts, read online forums, reminded myself of the horrors of the last days gambling and still, it's there...I'm just going to have to keep busy for the rest of the evening until my basketball game comes on (I'm definitely not a sports gambler) and then perhaps a night's sleep will take care of these feelings."

He repeatedly tells me that hes blocked a bunch of online casinos and that it shouldnt be a problem but it always happens again. He's tried installing cold turkey app but he just reboots his phone when he gets the urge. Is there anyway or app that could help me help him.

But it still takes all my happiness away, my will to go out, I‚Äôve lost touch with most of my friends because of my gambling. I currently owe several of my friends. Yesterday was the last time I gambled. I hope I can stop for good this time. We can all do it guys!! Lets keep this devil at bay."
18,1,You Need To Hit Rock BottomI got to the point where I realized that it will take me at least a year of living very frugally to pay off all the debt I have incurred through compulsive gambling over the past 3-4 years. I have no interest in continuing to gamble because it will only increase the amount of time it will take me to repay my debt. All my urges are gone. I am fairly young and want to own a house and a nice vehicle one day so this is a step in the right direction. This may be controversial to say but you really need to hit rock bottom to realize how harmful gambling really is.

Day 1 again tomorrow

22,1,"From blowing savings to blowing loansI am starting to have sucidial thoughts now. Not from losing, but from this hell I keep dragging myself into again and again after taking 2-3 days off from gambling. 

Feb 23-march 4th: $8000 savings loss

March 7th: $2500 loan turned into $11000 profit and lost it. 


There is no such thing as stopping at winning and only realizing what I have done after losing always.



At the age of 29, I'm at the worst phase of my life( mentally , physically and financially)

Mentally: I'm never seen smiling or talking anymore. Gambling losses has destroyed me. 

Physically: workouts are helping, but I have started to feel really old and dead to even move. 

Financially: if my brain could stop, I'd stop at mid way at losses or peak wins. There will never be enough win to stop. 


Mind will agree to stop for a few days and then go back to gambling. Repeat cycle of self pain and torture. 


At this point, I feel like the most pathetic person alive that came back from gambling debt of $15000 in November to now sitting with $0 in bank and $2500 loan to repay."
23,1,Can someone please PM meI'm getting serious urges to gamble. I want to throw 1k on an online casino and I'm going to do it if I don't get some help
24,1,"¬£90k in debt and trying to stay afloatI found out 4 weeks ago today and I want my story to help the partners of compulsive gamblers keep their sh*t together.  If this helps just one person, it won't all be in vain. 
 [My Story](https://gamblerswife.life/)"
25,1,"I need some advice.Today I won ¬£3000 on a slot online. I was playing on a ¬£1 stake and it was the most surreal experience I have ever gone through. I know I have a problem gambling and tend to splash all my winnings right after getting them back into the slot, but not to this amount of money. 

Anyway to cut a long story short I blasted a thousand and a bit of it back into several games on higher stakes over the last few hours. When I gamble nothing stops me. I‚Äôll tell my self I‚Äôll do a hundred and if I lose I lose but once it‚Äôs all gone I just want to keep going, I‚Äôll make excuses like the balance isn‚Äôt a round number or I haven‚Äôt had a bonus yet ETC ETC. 

I am extremely down about my behaviour on blasting over 1/3 of my winnings and I need some type of help or experience from anyone else who has gone through something similar. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to reverse the withdrawal again and spend all of it, I literally can‚Äôt afford to but sometimes I just cannot stop myself. I feel like I‚Äôve lost even though I‚Äôve technically still got that two grand, and it just makes me want to try all of it to get that loss back and just get out and ban myself for good. I wanted to buy a car or a nice computer with that money but within hours I end up losing quite a chunk of it and I can‚Äôt find myself to be happy about still having that remainder left. Has this ever happened to any of you or can anybody help me try and get positive and stop this horrible cycle of hell. Gambling is truly evil."
26,1,"For the young adult gamblers: what I wish I knew back thenAt first I was shocked by some of the posts from young people, not because of their age (I started around 20) but because of the amounts involved (guess not all you kids are unable to find good jobs!).

First thing you need to realize: the gambling industry, just like the smoking industry, targets young people with their advertising. New customers are the #1 key to their business growth. They NEED them, as eventually the older guys age out or die (just like smokers). I remember a few years ago Ladbrokes (a UK/Ireland bookie) ran an ad called 'The Ladbrokes Life'. I always wondered why a bookie would have the words 'broke' and 'lad' in their name. I mean, wouldn't Ladrich be a better strategy?

But this particularly insidious ad showed me their media savvy was not an issue. And anyway, when something's addictive it really doesn't matter what you call the brand. This ad showed a gang of young guys in their 20s roaming around town, watching football matches, staring wide eyed at their phones, jumping and up and cheering at goals being scored. They had the slow mo 'Reservoir Dogs' walk going on, and freeze frames on each guy with nicknames like 'The Professor' flashing on each one. All these guys were having a great time living 'the Ladbrokes life'.

Last year, a neighbour of mine who lives in England, with a wife and kids, late 20s, threw himself into the path of an oncoming train. They had to collect his remains with a bucket. No one knew why. Then it came out that he had large debts to loan sharks because he was borrowing money to gamble. His father who is still alive, was a gambler, too. From what I hear he still is, but I don't go in the bookie any more.

That's the real 'Ladbrokes life'.

Young people are easy targets for organisations who want to entice them into risky behaviour. You think you're invincible and have plenty of time. Death seems a million years away. So the army, the smoking industry, and the gambling industry can grab you more easily.

Before I became an alcoholic and gambler, I didn't know things. Things like: these addictions have a genetic component. I didn't grow up around my extended family as my parents immigrated to the US when I was young. I started playing poker and betting football around 2000, my mother moved back to Europe around that time and I moved back also around 2006, thinking it was great that gambling on sports was legal and there was casino with poker every night nearby. I then found out from my mother that her father was a notorious gambler who literally lost an entire farm in a poker game. I met a guy who played with my grandfather, and said he met him one day with a couple grand in his pocket, which, in those days in that area, was enough to buy a house. He saw him again later that night and he was flat broke, looking to bum money for a taxi home.

My mother's 3 brothers:  brother #1 was an excellent carpenter, earned over a million in 10 years working in London. He died penniless due to gambling. Brother 2, had over 40k in debt at one point (he then quit and went into recovery and is doing well now). Brother 3, has also quit, after an episode just 2 years ago where he lost 4k during a drinking binge. He walked into the pub he placed the bets with the next day with no memory of it and got the bad news. Both those guys paid their debts btw.

So you young guys need to look at your family history and see if you have alcoholics or gamblers in your genepool. Chances are you do. If they're alive, ask yourself do you want their life. If not, ask yourself would you be happy to have your life end the way theirs did."
27,1,Day 161
28,1,Idiot promoting casino bonusses to me. I regularly post on r/problemgambling about my addiction. This guy is seriously hunting addicted people. What a jackass.
29,1,"Working The Steps: Step 8My name is Russ and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. Back to Step Work for this blog and Step 8 is the next one up. I‚Äôve gotten so much out of working the Steps it really has helped me on my recovery journey. As usual, anything in bold or italics is from the worksheet, the rest is my own.

*Step 8: Made a list of all persons we had harmed and*

*became willing to make amends to them all.*

***Step 8, Exercise 1***

*Write about:*

***In what ways (spiritually, emotionally, mentally, physically, financially) did you harm yourself through gambling. List and write about them. Be specific.***

Spiritually - Psychology Today states ‚ÄúSpirituality can mean different things to different people. For some, it's primarily about participation in organized religion. For others, it's a non-religious experience that involves getting in touch with their spiritual selves through private prayer, yoga, meditation, quiet reflection, or time in nature.‚Äù So, with that, considering I am not a religious person and I don‚Äôt want to avoid answering this part of the step I am going to focus on the non-religious part. I view spirituality as getting in touch with your inner self, being able to focus and improve the inner me and the only thing my addiction did was make me truly hate who I was deep inside. The further I got into my addiction, the deeper I dug my own hole, the more I hated and resented who I was. Gambling was destroying the inner me so much that I had no idea who I was anymore.

Emotionally - My addiction made me emotionally numb, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything for anyone, not even myself. At the start I would be emotional about wins and losses but towards the end I didn‚Äôt care anymore. When I look back now I can see the vicious cycle I was stuck in, I‚Äôll try to explain it here. I gambled to escape, I fully believe that. What was I escaping from? Who I was inside was one, gambling would allow me to escape that person for a short time. The real world, responsibilities, gambling allowed me to escape those as well. Emotions though, these were the big things I feel like I was escaping from. They were always something I have struggled with, expressing them, being honest about how I felt, controlling them and gambling allowed me to escape having to deal with them. When I gambled it would numb my emotions, I thought I was happy when gambling but really I was just escaping. I didn‚Äôt feel anything, the addiction took over and it was like I was on autopilot. At that point though I thought I was controlling my emotions by gambling. The chasing my losses came when the money was about to run out and I realised I would have to go back into the real world and no longer would I feel safe the way I did in my online world of gambling. So I would chase my losses to get more fuel to allow me to escape longer. The longer I could escape the more numb my emotions became until I came back to reality once the fuel finally ran out. I couldn‚Äôt deal with who I was, responsibilities or emotions in the real world so I desperately needed to get more money to get allow me to escape. This was the cycle I was stuck in. I didn‚Äôt realise at the time that gambling was causing a lot of this damage because I was blinded by my addiction. Towards the end I still had that small hope, that little thought that somehow, someway, I could gamble my way out of this mess. That was the addiction talking and thinking for me because it had totally consumed me.

Mentally - I was a broken man when I finally owned up to my partner about my gambling addiction. It was like my brain had put me into a nosedive and was flying me towards rock bottom. The weekend before I asked for help I could feel that sensation, that sense of inevitability. This was going to end in disaster unless I reached out for help. The thing that scared me the most about asking for help and admitting my problem was at the time I knew I would lose the one thing I loved the most in this whole world. It wasn‚Äôt my kids, it wasn‚Äôt my partner, it was gambling. Even at that point, after all it had put me through, I was still terrified that I would never be able to gamble again. That‚Äôs how mentally broken I had become. I loved gambling, I still do in a weird way but that‚Äôs for another time. My addiction had pushed me to the edge, my mental edge of how much I could take at that moment. I think addiction has a real bend but don‚Äôt break mentality. It wants to push us to that edge, to push us far enough that we still come back to it each time. Once it breaks you though, there only seems to be two options, recovery or death. I still can‚Äôt believe I admitted to my partner I had a problem, but I did and it‚Äôs saved my life.

*‚ÄúYou hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. It is the sound of your death. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.‚Äù*¬†

*Agent Smith*

Physically - I wouldn‚Äôt eat healthy when gambling because I saw it as a waste of my money. I would live on energy drinks, coffee and biscuits while at work. Have dinner at home and snack into the wee hours while gambling on shite tennis in the middle of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt exercise (to be fair I still don‚Äôt) but I wouldn‚Äôt want to leave the house at all when I was gambling. Lack of sleep was another massive thing for me. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for me to be sitting up until 4am and then waking up with the kids at 6am. Doing that day after day eventually catches up with you. I‚Äôd crash early one night then just repeat the cycle. I was constantly late for work as I couldn‚Äôt motivate myself to get up and get going. I was a mess.

Financially - Gambling has destroyed me financially when I look at it. I‚Äôve debt that will take me 10 years to pay off at the current rate, my credit rating is destroyed and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions for a long time. I‚Äôll probably never be fully trusted with money by my partner and anytime something happens with regards to money the first thought in everyone's mind will be was I gambling. The chance to buy a nice car or house in the near future are out the window and I have to make do with what I have at the moment. This next part is going to sound super selfish because when it comes to finances I don‚Äôt care how long it takes to pay back, it will be paid back eventually. I don‚Äôt focus on it, I‚Äôm in no rush. Now, it has impacted other people as well which I will get to in the next section, but for me personally my attitude to it all is...it is what it is.

***Make a detailed list of all others you harmed through your gambling. Describe how you harmed them. Be specific.***

My Partner - This links nicely after the financial section above because, although it isn‚Äôt the main issue, I believe my partner has been hurt by me financially. Now all the debt is in my name, it is my own debt, but obviously there is the wasted money and the money I am paying out each month in debt repayments. More importantly though is the lies, the hurt, the bullshit I have put her through over the years. She said to me recently, ‚Äúyou are so in touch with your emotions now when for years you didn‚Äôt give a fuck about mine when you were sitting up all night gambling.‚Äù She‚Äôs not wrong. My behaviour has definitely had an effect on our relationship.¬†

My Kids - I‚Äôm lucky in a way that my kids are so young that I probably have a chance to make things right with them. They are blissfully unaware at the moment about my gambling addiction but it is something I will talk to them about when they are older. What I do know I have done to them is shouted at them for no reason, making them feel bad because I was having a shit time gambling. I ignored them to gamble. I made them feel like they were annoying me when they were fighting for my attention and affection. Bottom line is, they played number 2 to my gambling, to my addiction.

My Parents - The bank of Mum and Dad was a thing I took the piss with right up until I was 32. I was constantly borrowing money, of course all based on lies, and then struggling to pay it back. When I struggled I just assumed they would be ok to wait but I didn‚Äôt think how that made them feel. Turns out it made them feel awful because they didn‚Äôt like asking for the money back. I used them as a babysitting service but could barely muster up a conversation with them. My Mum had cancer during my addiction and I never asked her how she was, I didn‚Äôt show concern, I just let her get on with it. I also hurt them by not feeling like I could open up to them about how I was really feeling.

Other Family Members - Birthdays, anniversaries, visits, whatever it was I was on my phone gambling and ignoring what was going on. I didn‚Äôt want to be at these things because they were getting in the way of my gambling and I was anti-social at events. More than that, I was an ignorant bastard. January 2019 my Granda passed away and at the funeral everyone was so emotional, I didn‚Äôt understand. I didn‚Äôt feel anything. It makes me feel terrible now but that‚Äôs just the truth, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything because my addiction had destroyed my emotions.

My Friends - The amount of lies I told my friends, from why I couldn‚Äôt go out to why I needed to borrow money from them. It was all the time and got worse over time. I owed my friends so much money and on top of that I stole from the NFL fantasy football leagues I run. I broke the trust of everyone close to me, I lied to their face or over text, I avoided them when I had to pay back money.

My Job - Honestly, I‚Äôve no idea how I‚Äôm employed. In fact, I got a promotion during my addiction, towards the end of it. My productivity was terrible, my interactions with other staff members was awful and my level of customer service was a disgrace. This is worse because I am dealing with vulnerable people.

***Step 8, Exercise 2***

*Write about:*

***Review your lists from Step 8, Exercise 1. Are you carrying any guilt or shame over the harm you did to others? Are you still angry or blaming others for the harm done to you? Write about your feelings of guilt, shame, anger or blame.***

Currently I have to say I am still ashamed of what I have done in the past and how my actions, especially those to my family, have affected them. I didn‚Äôt lose any relationships over this addiction, although that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen if I do not keep up with my recovery. When it comes to anger and blaming others for the harm done to me I never experienced that in recovery. From day one I fully accepted I was to blame for my addiction and although the gambling industry could be doing a lot more, the bottom line is, no one held a gun to my head and made me gamble. Plus, if any bookmaker had stopped me when I was gambling I would have just found another one. The person who needed to change was me.

***Choose a way (visually, symbolically, spiritually or physically) to release your feelings of guilt, shame, anger or blame. Describe this process of letting go and how you felt afterward.***

I still get feelings of shame when I go back and write about certain things that have happened in the past but in general I feel like I am in an ok place. Writing has really helped me process thoughts and feelings of guilt and shame and the other thing that has helped me was understanding and accepting the serenity prayer.

*‚ÄúGrant me the serenity,*

*To accept the things I cannot change,*

*The courage to change the things I can,*

*And the wisdom to know the difference‚Äù*

***Are there any legal or financial situations you created while gambling with which you will need additional assistance or support to make direct amends/repayments? Are you willing to ask for help with them (i.e. from a sponsor, Pressure Relief group, employer, court system, bank/creditor)?***

Yes, I am currently in a Debt Management Plan which is through Step Change debt charity and they have helped me massively.

I then deposited $4k, and turned it in to $11k.. And guess what, I just lost all of that. I‚Äôm having such a hard time even coping with life right now. 

I‚Äôm going through a divorce, and now I do this dumb shit and it makes me even question why I‚Äôm still alive.

32,1,Gambling addicts wife here. Words to use to explain to him how badly his gambling effects me. And looking for other wives in the same position as I'm in.
33,1,"Right Back Down to Rock BottomI gambled everything away again, today.  I feel like dying...

Please someone tell me how to want to want to stop gambling (yes I typed this sentence correctly)...part of me still doesn't want to stop, but I want to find a way to somehow override that part of me and stop gambling for good.

I've already self-excluded from casinos in my state, but they aren't actively looking for me...so I can go there and gamble and get not get caught.  I've also joined a CBT type of anti-gambling group, that is basically GA with homework (I take home worksheets and have to answer questions related to gambling addiction).

Any help would be appreciated.  I just want this bullshit to stop.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone here for the kind words and the advice...I'll just take this day by day, and look into additional solutions for overcoming this addiction."
34,1,Day 11Still feeling good without the need to gamble. The what ifs in my head are still messing with me
35,1,"32 daysEnjoying over a month of freedom from the disease.  I've started reading Allen Carr's book again, and spending my free time listening to podcasts, spending more time with the kids and wife, and letting loose.  Can't remember the last time I sat down with my kids to play video games or toss a frisbee, I was too busy gambling.  Most recent memory is when we were at the zoo, and the monkeys were jumping around, and I was watching a football game on my phone, and my boy was just so dissapointed.  It was a crap feeling.  Life for the last 32 days hasen't been perfet.  I have created a major tsunami of financial damage, will take more than 32 days to fix, but at least it's not getting worse.  Work is going well and I find myself generally looser and calmer, despite the financial stress.  Every day for me is a new milestone and a small step in the right direction.  Good luck to everyone here ... for those of you in your 20s writing about how your life is over because you just lost a few thousand dollars, learn from the mistakes of us older folks who wish we could go back to our 20s and only be down a few k.

38,1,"Gambling Sent Me To A Psych WardSince the visit I haven‚Äôt been gambling, the thought of it raises my anxiety and causes paranoia. I honestly never seen myself that low before but I was at my low point and that‚Äôs where I ended up. 

It was two weeks ago tuesday and after I won all my money back, my dumba** went back and I lost it all again. So that morning, I resorted to selling my items like I used to. I sold an apple watch, xbox, iphone, basically all my electronics and with almost 200+ collected, I still lost.

I fell into a deep, deep depression that almost resulted in suicide. I couldn‚Äôt work, every time I drove I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and I had a constant thought of running of the road to end it all. Night time comes, I planned to end it, left my phone with a note for my roommates to find, went out with no wallet and started driving. I was driving for about 30 minutes before something told me to go to a hospital because honestly i‚Äôm scared of the ‚Äúend‚Äù. 

Told them about my intentions and I was on watch for 24 hrs. What I did not know that my evaluation would lead to a judge deciding I was not able to make my own decisions so I was dragged to another hospital where they wheel me to a psych ward. Honestly after falling asleep overnight, I felt better but it was too late for all that. 

I was TERRIFIED, no it‚Äôs not like the movies but I was still VERY uncomfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was in there with psychos but I was with people who weren‚Äôt mentally stable, drug addicts, and people who ACTUALLY need to be put on suicide watch. I cried for hours, they were trying to get me checked in and I just kept crying. I asked how long will I be in here, they said maybe 2-3 days and I continued to cry, I made a grave mistake. 

It wasn‚Äôt bad but again I didn‚Äôt want to be there and I knew I didn‚Äôt need to be there. I have my moments, everyone does, but when I‚Äôm down it‚Äôs not an immediate thought to just end it all. I‚Äôve never felt like that before and it lead to me tell people false information I was only feeling at the time. 

Long story short, I got out the next day that morning and I haven‚Äôt looked back since. A therapist has actually told me I may be traumatized by this happening. It all started because I wanted my money back and I was desperate to do anything to get it back, as the open minded person I was, I fell into a trapped I created myself and the only I got out was by scaring myself to death. 

I‚Äôm 20 years old and I started when I was 17, my biological mother introduced it to me. It was a bonding thing at first but I went out my own way to keep money in my pocket using my dads money. It started small, with fear of losing no more than twenty or forty, having control over how much I would spend to no control at all. It got worst my freshman year and college and this year, as you‚Äôve read, it almost got to the point of no return. 

I‚Äôm done..honestly, I thought about playing the lottery, mega millions, but I needed to win because if i lose money I would have gotten upset. Seeing those sweepstakes makes me almost cry, because i knew where it lead me and it won‚Äôt EVER again."

46,1,"Deep discovery. Gambling addiction, or self-sabotaging my success.Hi Everybody!

First, thank you for sharing your stories guys. It really helps to know that there are people with similar problems and that maybe I am not the stupidest human in the world, but just a sick person who needs help.

I am 28 and gambling was somewhere in my life for the last 12 years. The first time I played was on slots with my dad in a pub when I was 10. Guess what? I won... Unfortunately. A couple of years went by and I was 16 when I saw a slot machine, walking out of the cinema with my friends. Guess what? I won... unfortunately. I was hooked immediately. I started playing slots all the time, almost every day for a couple of years. I destroyed my relationship with my current girlfriend, sold some things from home, stole some money from my mom. People knew I liked to play, but they didn't know that I lose my fucking mind in those places. I was able to go out of a very special party like a wedding, tell people I am going to call somebody and literally run, take a cab, go to the casino and spend there 3 hours, not answering my phone from anybody. It really turns me into a crazy person who is able to go through a lot to gamble.

  
As I grew a bit older, around 23 and became independent, I realized I have a huge problem and I have to stop gambling. I did. For the last 5 years, I haven't played slots while SOBER. I could not play for months. The problem was, that whenever I got very drunk, I ended up in the casino losing crazy money. ""Crazy""- I don't mean the amount, I mean f.e. rent money. I was in debt for a year, took some stupid loans.   
I was saving for a couple of months for smth and then was able to lose it all while drunk... The frustration, guilt, not understanding what the fuck is wrong with me, it is just literally crazy.   
WHAT THE FUCK?? How can a person save money for months, working 12+h a day and then go drunk to the casino and lose most of it?? How is that possible?? It must be some fucking insanity!

  
So all this time I thought I have a problem with gambling. Don't get me wrong, I do, but today I came to a bit different conclusion. 

I gamble and lose all my money while drunk in the casino. It puts me in the position in which I really have to struggle. Work hard, focus on my growth, make money, move forward. So I spend some time in this struggle, let's say 5 months. After this time, I finally can say that I am doing quite well. I am even happy with myself, I have some money on my bank account, I could do a lot of things.   
You see, the problem is, that I have this money, but I am afraid to spend it. I think that I should save more, that this is still not enough. That I should save for a house or something like this. So I don't spend this money. And when I feel so good about myself, so secure, money in my bank account..... the point comes....when I think that I should allow myself to have a bit of fun and party. After the party, knowing about the money in my bank account, guess how I feel? I don't think about anything else than gambling...... Nothing could happen.... I have a lot of money... I can play a little bit.... action.... I'll have some fun..... 

I'm ending up losing a huge part of my money or all of it.....

It puts me back in the place where I begin my struggle to save money.....

This circle has been repeating itself for the last couple of years...

Now, what am I addicted to???? Am I addicted to gambling?  Or, being a homo sapiens, knowing how gambling ends every fucking time, am I doing it subconsciously to not achieve anything bigger in life and put myself back in the place where I have nothing and feel like shit.....  


And I'm thinking today...   LOGICALLY, I know how it will end when I will go gamble, I think we all know.....but.. EMOTIONALLY... that's where gamble has got me.... that's where I, through gambling am sabotaging my success and happiness.

And the answer and the way to stop gambling is, I think, in focusing on and healing these emotions within me.

52,1,"The Dangers of Cryptocurrencies Gambling and my experienceI've decided to create a new identity to share my story, with hope that by reaching out and speaking out for the first time I may be able to overcome my gambling addiction, as it is only recently that I have accepted that I have an issue. I find it difficult to open up about this in person to the missus, friends or family, I have covered it up with lies and played it down for almost a year, but now it needs to stop.

I discovered Bitcoin May 2019 start of Bitcoin bull run to 14k, I didn't have any trading knowledge but I am a programmer I am enthusiastic about the tech (It's cliche I know all say this, but the future of tech excites me I became obsessed, and I wanted a piece of it). I don't really value money because at the time I had my day job, and an additional programming contract which gave me a lot more income then I currently have now. I had everything I could ever want, 65-inch tv, cool tech, my own house mortgaged everything was perfect, and had a bright future financially. Since then the contract has slowed down which has reduced my income significantly, but I have enough to get by, whilst I need to focus on paying these debts I have accumulated. 

Before I discovered Bitcoin, Gambling has never been an issue for me, I was completely uninterested and thought it was stupid. I liked the trading because it almost felt strategic, I studied the charts for months and I did bag some losses, eventually taking out the occasional 2k loan here and there (with full intentions of paying it back, once I received a good return), because the issue with trading with crypto is you need capital to make a decent return and I wanted all the time I spent watching the charts to be worth while. I don't value money like I should because of all my extra income so I allowed myself to get into extra debt. When I originally took the loans out I planned to do low risk trades, in fact one time I turned a ¬£4k loan to being offered a 12k cash out, but of course I was so sucked in that I lost that, and have continued to put in money since. The issue comes into play when you put a trade in strategically, it goes wrong, and you turn up the margin/leverage on the trade to chase that originally loss.

Money doesn't make me happy, and I don't value it like I probably should. I could be sitting next to my missus and lose ¬£1,000+ and she would never even know (and that is a lot of money to me) I feel like after doing more research that I must have some sort of chemical imbalance in my brain needing those reward pathways hit regularly which trading crypto was hitting for me. I live alone, I'm lonely a lot but feel depressed so I do not make effort with friends or family. It's made me depressed that I have got myself into such a mess and feel I can't reach out to anyone about it as I am so ashamed of myself. 

I have tried to quit before, but normally have a relapse and blow more. I'm hoping this is the last time. 

Thanks for reading and it would be cool to hear any similar stories and if you managed to overcome it, and if you think it's possible to do it alone."
53,1,"HELP - Lost $8k this week huge regretI lost $8k day trading this week. I feel like I am addicted I have a very addictive personality. I was doing small trades for the last month pretty much broke even then this week the whole market crashed my portfolio lost a good bit and to chase my losses I did some big day trades. I am not mathematically inclined and do not want to do them going forward it's not realistic I will come out winning and I really don't enjoy day trading at all. I started to enter trades a few times then stopped myself which makes me think I am semi-addicted but this afternoon tried one yolo move (on my phone was a quick impulse buy) and lost $6k in a few minutes.

I have an addictive personality but usually very strong will power and can stop myself. Used to have a pretty nasty anxiety disorder when I was younger I managed to over come.

73,1,"Three weeks gamble-free tomorrow. Here's what I've realised.Tomorrow will mark the first time in four years that I've gone three weeks without gambling. The money I have saved since my last paycheck is great, but what I have realised is that the money lost from gambling, and retained when quitting, pales in comparison to the time lost when gambling and retained when quitting.

I used to spend countless hours gambling. Full eight hour shifts that felt like days when working would go by in a flash when gambling. Now, I've exchanged that time with reading. I have read both fiction and non-fiction in the past three works and I already feel enriched. 

The truth is, money comes and goes but the time we spend gambling is time we will never get back. Don't look at giving up gambling as a sacrifice, look at it as an opportunity to harness a new skill, enrich your life and become a better human. The best way to forget about gambling is to replace it with something that you know is making you a better person. You will feel proud of yourself. And no big win could replace that feeling."

79,1,"I can't stop my self? 18 and a life full of nothing but addictions and despairHello.. posting here because I don't know what to do anymore. This first week of March has already felt like months of hell and I want to know how to get out of this hole. I have never said anything about this to anyone as I am embarrassed by it and would rather not deal with any extra judgement that may be received. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that my problem started at the age of 15 - I had just discovered bitcoin and decided to play $50 which I had received as a gift - after transferring everything and doing the exchanges, I ended up with around $20 to play with online. I lost it.. and I felt like utter shit for 2 days - I was a 16 year old who had lost $50 I had received as a gift. A week goes by and I feel better, and I had recently started a job at a fast food chain so I was making 100-200 a week. A few weeks went by playing $50 each week, until a miracle happened - I had turned $50 through a variety of different websites using martingale (I know, stupid indeed but by some odd change I had managed to make a huge amount) into around $200,000 AUD at the time (worth much more now in bitcoin rates). This was the day after Christmas of 2017 I believe - I withdrew the money and went to sleep finally after a long night of gambling (I had withdrew and redeposited into multiple different websites multiple times through the night constantly telling myself I'd stop soon.. so I did, at 200,000 - or so I thought). I woke up the next morning and instantly put it all back in - I did some very stupid bets (they got very large, I did not realize just how quickly a bet can go from $10 to $20,000) and ended up with $0 - well, this was the end of it. Or so I thought. After a day of beating my self up, I kept quite - went back to school, didn't say anything to anyone - of course, it might have been noticeable how miserable I was. Fast track a few weeks later, I started stealing. Yes, I know - I regret every decision I made and I have always felt guilty for what I did - I was midway into 16 at the time and spent every school night on my iPad making around three to four hundred dollars through different schemes which I always put back into the websites. Not once did i get close to repeating what I had made during the big win - I always thought, next one. But the next one was never it. Eventually, I started betting during school every few days and some mates caught on and started playing with me - small amounts, but we had fun gambling together during classes. It was when I was the only one playing all day and all night by myself that I realized I may have had a problem - but no, I could stop at any time I said to my self. This was the first stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened next, was I turned 18 and discovered sports betting. After a few thousand dollars in losses, I stopped myself from that and found my new preferred method of gambling - online casinos (not bitcoin, but aud) - I would spend every day playing on a new casino trying to beat the odds and not once did I do it. I did make a few big wins, but never pulled out and always (and i repeat, always, no matter how much I pulled out, I ended up losing all the profits and more the next day) lost. A few weeks into being 18, I discovered my worst enemy - the poker machines. I was new to all of this - me and a few friends went into a pub and saw a couple of machines - we were curious and each chucked in a few dollars. After we all lost our money, they all wanted to leave but I was different - I was the only one who put in more. I had no idea what the machines were or how to play them but I ended up spending an hour playing a few dollars - it was boring to me. I didn't understand it - ""how could anyone be addicted to these piece of shit machines?"" I thought. Fast forward a few weeks and I started going more often - I would play larger amounts and win larger amounts - it was getting more exciting (and would still get more, the more I learned about features and different machines.) After getting arrested and losing my license for a year around the time of my exams (two separate incidents which happened very closely to each other) I ended up with over $5,000 in fines to pay (court fine, impound fee, etc). I had a plan to pay them all off in a few months time. But at this time, I was falling in love with the poker machines. My family kept questioning where I was until 4am every morning, my girlfriend was constantly asking what I was doing - I always had an answer. This was my issue. I am a compulsive liar and have no problem lying about anything to anyone - it happens easily. My plan to pay off my fines did not happen. Couple months passed and I had spent almost every dollar at the pokies going every night hoping to make enough to pay off my fines - I spent all my paychecks and if I hadn't, I would have had enough to pay them off and not have this massive headache. I had to take out a loan. I took out a loan for double what I owed last week (around $10,000) - and this is where the real issue began. I had lied about my fines to everyone - my family, friends, etc. I told them I owed nothing more than $2,000 and that my loan was no more than $3,000. With this in mind, I had the mindset that the surplus of $5,000 was disposable - so what did I do? I went to Crown. The big place where it all happens. 3 days of playing and I made a few thousand dollars - i was up. But I was not happy with where I was. I started to skip university to go to Crown and in the span of 2 days, lost more than $8,000 which I had from the loan and all my extra savings/paychecks. One would think that these events would help me to stop - but no, this further worsened my problems. Since I was 16 I have had a problem with drugs (I would do a range of drugs, usually at school or at night when I wouldn't have to deal with my family, and spend the days messing around). Around a few weeks ago I had developed an addiction to cocaine (I say this as I am about to snort another key at 4am with uni work due in 8 hours). For the past 2 weeks I have spent the beginning and end of every day at a venue in an attempt to make back my very first massive win - but this has become more of an issue as my once a week cocaine habit had become daily (every couple of hours, which became every hour, which became every 30 minutes of playing) so while I was playing, I always always snorting before, during and after which made me very, very, compulsive - I had made many large wins which any smart person would have cashed out but to me - it was never enough. No matter how many massive features or wins I had (which attracted the attention of many onlookers) it was never enough for me. One more spin, I would always say as I drained my last few hundred down the drain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here, 3 hours after losing my last thousand dollars and last bag of cocaine, in bed at 4am contemplating whether to start my uni work due in a few hours or to just sleep and hope for the best, thinking of ways to fuel my addictions for the next few days knowing I should stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's the thing - I can't stop. I know I should. I want to. But I can't. My urge to do these things is stronger than my will to stop - ""you should stop"" becomes ""you can stop when you want, but why stop now? it feels so good and you'll win eventually"" - I know if I talk to someone it won't help me because I'm stubborn and will relapse very shortly so I am posting this here in hopes that maybe someone can relate or to find out if anyone can provide any advice as I am very lost and have no idea what to do anymore and I'm absolutely sick of it. I'm hiding my drug and gambling addiction from family, friends, my girlfriend - it is so obvious and everyone is suspicious but I am still lying to hide it. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm done.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you if you managed to read this far and I hope that you can provide any advice at all about what to do to cut these addictions - I'm so fed up with this life already."

81,1,"Day 1 after 6 years. Feel emptyI am now 22 &amp; I have been gambling on football since I was 16.

It started at ¬£5 bets but I have staked ¬£1000 bets in my time. I have won big. Very big but lost it all through not being able to control it.

December 2019 I won 40k &amp; lost it all in January.

Deep down I know I can choose great selections but mentally I cannot stop doing something.

If I had ¬£500 in my account &amp; I found something I really like for tomorrow I can guarantee I won't wait &amp; id place something tonight.

I am really frustrated within myself for not being able to be patient as I feel I wouldn't be on here now. Does anyone else know what I mean? You feel like you know the sport inside &amp; out but you cannot control yourself.

I think that's what hit me the most knowing I can choose great selections, but i just waste it on bets I'm not confident about / being impatient.

I have blocked myself from all gambling online since this morning &amp; I am finding it very hard. I have been doing this basically everyday since I was 16. It's a huge hobby of mine &amp; now i just feel like i just want to lay in bed all day.

Have i dont the right thing completely excluding or is there better steps to try &amp; control my impulsiveness? Staking ¬£500 on singles &amp; getting to 40k is impressive. I couldn't do that if I didnt know the sport but I just cant controlled myself &amp; end up doing something at 2am on Bolivia.

89,1,"Knowing its time to stopHello guys, today I had an experience that made me realize that I need to stop gambling asap and thought that it could serve as a cautionary tale to everyone here

A few years ago I was betting regularly, but after a couple of losses I was able to stop betting, which was easier at the time as I didn't have any responsibilities and bills to pay.

Last year I started betting again at a very accelerated rate, but it still wasn't a problem because I was still paying my bills on time.

At this point I'm in college and only really have my credit card bill to pay, which with my part-time job that pays 80$ a week I was able to pay easily.

But last month things quickly changed when I spent more then i should on my credit card and thought that betting would be how i would get the money that was missing.


Since then things spiralled out of control and I'm now 850$ in debt.


Yesterday, i put my last 50$ in a betting site, and somehow I was able to reach 1100$, which would suffice to pay my bills and some.
But after reaching such a high number I was pretty sure I was invincible, and didn't think that withdrawing money to only pay my debts was enough. I wanted more. And then...

Boom.

One bad decision and I was back in 0.

This made me realize that I need to stop. Despite how much I'm dreading having to work 2/3 months only to pay my debt I will do it. I will do anything to quit gambling.


Thanks for reading, hope you have a great day"

I only see gambling as a wayout but that's the reason i'm in this situation. It started as 5-10 euros sports betting when i was in high school and kept going while the amount keep getting bigger. I didn't sleep more than 2-3 hours last week. Sometimes i want to go confess my family everything and ask for their help but i lost the 50k from the business my father built for me anyways and i don't know how to explain it to him while he works his ass off everyday to keep family business together.

100,1,"Reflection today-just take your money and use it for good, any good.If tempted to gamble today I hope you take the money you would be spending on it and pay a bill, pay extra to a debt you owe, buy yourself something you need like clothes or something for home.

I just got out (yesterday) of one of my worst binges. Although I didn't gamble every day I gambled close enough to every day for about a week.

I knew I was behind in 2 bills and I wanted to pay extra to a debt that's been stressing me. Undecided which if these 3 options to put first I tried to take the money that would pay one and turn it into enough for all 3.

That of course did not happen and I went up and down a bunch until it was finally really gone.

Now today I called the two bills I'm behind and made the arrangement to get caught up when I get paid Friday.  Which is only a few days away. All is well.  But a week ago it was closer to 2 weeks away-and that seemed overwhelming.

So my reflection is how silly it all is. Had I just used the money to pay one thing and made arrangements for the others I would have had less stress, wasted less money, and had the extra bit of money on Friday when I get paid that will now go to catching up.

Im glad this latest binge is done and I'm feeling back on track. The amount I lost is pretty small in the grand scheme but to me, someone working so hard to do better, it is a lot.

So my wish is anyone who reads this takes the money you want to gamble today and put it somewhere better."

104,1,"Sick and tired of being sick and tired.Didn't want to wake up today after last night's bender. Haven't felt this way since I first succomed to slots back in June. Tens of thousands of dollars later I realize I'm so screwed up. I didn't have the money to gamble last night. I have just paid my bills for last month and I don't know how I'm going to make payments for the month of March. Dumb ass me spent my property tax bill on slots and lost it all. Now I'll have to pay the late fee when I pay it later this month. It's like I'm addicted to this self destructive bs I put my body through. 

Had a very productive weekend. GF was sick and went to bed early and I got the itch and starred at my phone for 4+ hours till it was all gone. I always bet till its gone even though beforehand I want to get to a certain amount of profits and withdraw but the profit never comes. Just a roller coaster till it's gone.

Today was the worst. Told my business partner I was sick and didn't come in. Didn't want to wake up and deal with life. Depression caused by gambling is so unnecessary and I'm sick of it. Not going to say never again am I gambling because I've said that before but here I was today sick and tired from gambling. Maybe I'll remember this feeling next time I want to gamble, I hope so.

The worst part is that I could of went up and cuddled with my girlfriend and thought about the past weekend but I got greedy and ended up doing this to myself and lied to her, lied to my business partner, lied to myself. 

I'm a compulsive, degenerate gambler and I'm on a very destructive path of self destruction. Only positive from today was watching a documentary on baby boomers losing their retirement savings to gambling. I'm 31 so maybe I'll learn my lesson and don't screw up my retirement years if I even get that far in life.

My weekend were spent trying to stable out my mood. No motivation to accomplish anything around the house. I woke up with a heaviness in my chest. It's strange how anxiety and the subconscious mind are connected.

Anyways folks, take care of yourselves and those around you. We often do not think about it when we are gambling. Peace and love."
106,1,"March Madness from a Compulsive GamblerFeels like the right time to make my first post - on Day 68 of no gambling ahead of college basketball‚Äôs 68 team tournament that I‚Äôve bet on for the last 16 years...since I was 16.  This is the year I even it up by not betting on March Madness for the Sweet 16th time (ages 0-15 and this year of course, lol).

Here‚Äôs how I made it to Day 68 and how I‚Äôm going to breeze through the tournament without the urge to gamble on it.

My decision to stop gambling 2 months ago had one major difference than my previously failed attempts:  I was finally entirely honest with myself, and recognized my gambling problem.  More specifically than admitting I have a gambling problem, I fully understand that I am and forever will be a Compulsive Gambler.

I don‚Äôt know the intricacies of AA/NA/GA programs, but my understanding is that ‚Äúadmitting you have a problem‚Äù is the first step.  For me, I‚Äôve had to not only admit that I have a problem, but more importantly...I‚Äôve had to take ownership of my problem.  

There is beauty in taking ownership of our flaws.  My compulsive gambling flaw is in my DNA, might as well wear it on my sleeve so I know where it is so it can‚Äôt fuck me without me noticing.

This NCAA Tourney, I‚Äôll be filling out my bracket for me and only me.  Printing it out, picking games by hand, and casually watching.  Not even going to fill out a free bracket online for a million bucks or some other prize - because winning a risk-free prize would be the worst thing imaginable for me right now.  It would spark my interest in gambling again and restart my chase to obsessively try to recover my sunken losses.  Feels good to admit - I am a compulsive gambler and I have no desire to ever win another bet.

So if you feel the urge or pressure to join that close friend‚Äôs, family, or office bracket pool...instead just say ‚ÄúI never win those - just gonna kick back and watch the games this year.‚Äù  

Order some take out and enjoy the madness stress-free!"
107,1,"Day 1: hopefully never again a day 1I lost my last $ of savings. Luckily, I have now asked all local and online casinos for life time ban.

My mind was on a mission for self destruction for the last 2 weeks. Despite losing all my savings, I know I can get through this. 

I have 2nd job lined up, so hopefully working 16 hours a day will keep my mind away from gambling. 

I broke down at work today for the first time and mentally couldn't deal with why my mind can't be in control? Why am I doing this to myself? Why am I blowing away $1000 a day and not stopping at profit? 

I will really get into meditation for inner peace, as I am totally destroyed mentally and spiritually, fighting my own battle.

Sharing this addiction was my biggest mistake with parents and ex gf. They both left , instead of helping me through. I don't blame them, just myself for going back to this every 3-4 months after saving money."

110,1,"Had my first relapse, but I feel greatI‚Äôm writing this while enjoying a cigarette at 3am in my back garden. Like many people here, I‚Äôm treating  Reddit like a diary.

I‚Äôm only 19 but have been gambling for the last 4 years, faking my ID so I can play on online casinos.
And in those 4 years I have not once lost money and felt good about it, but tonight was different.

I hadn‚Äôt gambled in a week and I was detriments, this time no relapse, I get my weekly wages and meet up with my friends, they convince me to go to the casino and I spent the ¬£20 cash in my pocket and cash out another ¬£20, immediately sending the rest of the money on my account into my credit card. I lose my money after a nice run on Blackjack. I‚Äôd lost ¬£500 before and felt numb, I‚Äôve only had ¬£5 in my pocket before, spent it on gambling and felt numb. The number didn‚Äôt matter, I didn‚Äôt care if it was ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£40 or ¬£1000.

When we got back to my street, me and one of my friends have an argument, I ask him why he convinced me to come Casino when he knows I‚Äôm trying to stop myself.

He laughed and said that I‚Äôd never stick to it, there it was something in me clicked, I no longer wanted to be friends with this person, how can someone laugh in my face and tell me I‚Äôm too incompetent to keep to my word and the goal I set to myself ? I let him know I was serious and I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him for a while.

I‚Äôm sitting here, so glad I got rid of two toxic elements out of my life in one night, I don‚Äôt want to gamble for a long, long time, I don‚Äôt want to talk to that guy for a long, long time either.

117,1,"A Milestone, Sponsoring and StoicismMy name is Russ and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. 11 months ago and fuck me, time flies when you are having fun. That‚Äôs one of the things that has shocked me the most in my recovery, how much fun I am actually having. I really have made it a new lifestyle for myself and I feel like I am reaping the rewards. There are a few things I want to write about today and it‚Äôs really just to remind myself how far I have come, and not just since I stopped gambling, but I can see major leaps forward in myself during my recovery as well.

I have written before about my struggles with low self-esteem and how I basically didn‚Äôt believe in myself. How I couldn‚Äôt see the good in what I was doing, my actions, my writing or my recovery. I had this little voice telling me I was a fraud. That I was the same old guy who for 14+ years destroyed his life and damaged the lives of those closest to him. Through the help of my awesome support network (and I‚Äôm going to touch on one or two individuals in a moment) I have started to believe in myself. 

There‚Äôs two people I really want to focus on here, and that‚Äôs not to take away from the impact everyone else has had on my recovery, because I will get to that as well, but these two people are a major reason as to why I feel I have taken another major leap forward in my recovery. The first person I have only started to get to know fairly recently but we clicked pretty quick and talk daily. They have made me realise how much I offer to other people, how far I have come in my journey but most importantly, for me, they have pushed me to be the best version of myself. Often they‚Äôll call me out on my bullshit, which I definitely need from time to time but I feel like I can tell them anything and because of this, because of our chats, I have started to believe in myself. I feel like I can do anything in my recovery, including something I never thought I would do which is become a Sponsor.

Which brings me nicely onto the next person I want to talk about, no Jeff it isn‚Äôt you, I wrote enough about you in my A-Z, it‚Äôs my Sponsee. Since getting the opportunity to sponsor this person I have realised how much I have to give. If it‚Äôs just listening, chatting, sharing or working through something, I now know I am able to do that and it‚Äôs down to my Sponsee. They have truly helped me in so many ways take that major leap forward. They‚Äôve made me realise I deserve recovery and more than that, I deserve to be happy. I now have a confidence I didn‚Äôt know I had, I walk a little bit taller and with a spring in my step. I‚Äôm smiling more now than I have done in a long time. Seeing them making progress, doing so well, it drives me forward. I am so happy for them and I am so glad we are sharing this journey together.

Then we have everyone else, and that is so mean to group everyone together because I have gotten so fucking much from everyone else I have encountered in my recovery. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it past a month without the support of people in my G.A. or my Skype group. So many people have shared what worked for them and gave me the blueprint to make my own recovery work for me. I started putting effort into the GamCare chat rooms from about November time and have again connected with some wonderful people there who have helped me so much. The random people who leave messages on my Reddit Problem Gambling posts, thanking me for sharing my writing, that is an added bonus that makes me smile.

So where am I going with all this? I‚Äôve started to realise I am doing things for the right reasons now, which wasn‚Äôt always the case. When gambling, and even early in recovery, I craved praise when I did something. I needed to know that people thought I had done a good job or that they enjoyed what I had done. If I didn‚Äôt get that I‚Äôd start to think the worst, that people didn‚Äôt like me. Conversely, if I had done something wrong or hurt someone's feelings I needed to try and fix everything right away, for my benefit because I didn‚Äôt like tension or confrontation. Bottom line, I was a people pleaser and have been my whole life. Now I am starting to really focus on what I can control, and that is me. I don‚Äôt always get it right, but it‚Äôs progress not perfection.

I‚Äôm reading The Little Book of Stoicism at the moment and it sums up how I feel right now within myself. It‚Äôs called The Stoic Happiness Triangle, and although it isn‚Äôt what the Stoics taught per se, it‚Äôs the authors visualization of their core teachings.

**Eudaimonia:** At the core of the triangle is eudaimonia - the ultimate goal of life all ancient philosophies agreed on. This is the main promise of Stoic Philosophy and it‚Äôs about living a supremely happy and smoothly flowing life. It‚Äôs about thriving in our lives. So how can we achieve this? By living with arete.

**Live With Arete:** Express your highest self in every moment. If we want to be on good terms with our highest self, we need to close the gap between what we‚Äôre capable of and what we‚Äôre actually doing. This is really about being your best version in the here and now. It‚Äôs about using reason in our actions and living in harmony with deep values. What supports this ambitious goal is to separate good from bad and focus on what we control.

**Focus on What You Control:** This is the most prominent principle in Stoicism. At all times, we need to focus on the things we can control, and take the rest as it happens. What already  is has to be accepted because it‚Äôs beyond our power to undo it. What‚Äôs beyond our power is ultimately not important for our flourishing. What‚Äôs important for our flourishing is what we choose to do with the given external circumstances. So no matter the situation, it‚Äôs always within our power to try to make the best with it, and to live in harmony with our ideal self.

**Take Responsibility:** Good and bad come solely from yourself. This follows the first two corners that say external things don‚Äôt matter for the good life, so living with arete, which is within your control, is enough to flourish in life. Also, you‚Äôre responsible for your life because every external event you don‚Äôt control offers an area you can control, namely how you choose to respond to this event. This is crucial in Stoicism, it‚Äôs not events that make us happy or miserable, but our interpretation of those events. This is when a tower of strength can be born - the moment you decide to give outside events no more power over you.

*The above was taken from The Little Book of Stoicism: Timeless Wisdom to Gain Resilience, Confidence, and Calmness by Jonas Salzgeber, Nils Salzgeber and available on Amazon* [*https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MY2VFQD/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_d\_asin\_title\_o02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MY2VFQD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

I hear you! At this point we must simply go forward... day by day by day. That path of destruction is behind us. In my case I had total burnout and was *exhausted* by my losses and the actual act of gambling. Somehow I came out of the fog and it started to hit me just how much money was gone. It panicked me yet I also knew clarity and sound mind were returning. That has been priceless for me and I don‚Äôt want to return to that life anymore. I don‚Äôt miss it and just occasionally I think of a dumb machine I fell in love with and seconds later it hits me how crazy it all was. Fun yes (not always for sure), thrilling at times yes, catastrophic.... ?? YES. My savings account is extraordinary low... but... my peace of mind has landed. I feel free. That freedom has allowed me to make peace with my losses and my disease. It all still stings and it should. I don‚Äôt want to forget that horrendous pressure and that sinking feeling of all my losses. I think that helps me stay clean. You can do this. It really is day by day. I cannot take one bet.

122,1,"How do I know if I have a gambling problem?Hello all,

I don't know if I have a gambling problem, ego problem, delusion, or am just dumb. Is there a professional I can talk to to get insight into my behavior? I havent lost a lot of money in this recent game ive been playing, but I don't want it to turn into something crazy. My risk is about 10 cents per game so I am no where at risk of financial harm, and I have an amount where I will completely stop. But I keep coming back to the game after my emotions cool off and I don't know whats going on completely. I will hang around here a bit if anyone has questions."

I am currently on day three of this new chapter of my life and I never ever want to gamble again , I initially won this amount of money on the pokies only to give it all back the following week so I have now quit forever"

Feeling numb mentally and losses are not hurting me at all. As I mentioned, I lost the value of money. Not sure how to gain it back.

Only thing going for me is my bills are paid full on time and working out.


Maybe adopt a dog? So I'm forced to spend more time and walks with it? And maybe it will distract from not gambling at all and fill joy and happiness. I just feel empty."
133,1,Day 0Just lost $200 not feeling the best
134,1,"Day 1I'm not entirely sure how the format for posting here is supposed to go. I've been lurking on-and-off for a few months but I think I'm finally at a point where I could use some internet accountability if you guys (and gals) are up for it. I have a legitimate gambling problem. This will probably read like a diary entry but they're thoughts I'd like to put down. I'm in my mid-20's with a  decent job (shy of 100k annually) yet I'm always broke. I have expenses obviously but every expendable dollar I have I gamble with. I don't know the total but I've lost tens of thousands of dollars gambling. I use the term ""expendable"" loosely because I have student loans I could be paying off with this money.  


It's really hitting me hard the past couple weeks knowing how well I could be doing if I had never started gambling. Then I realize the amount of time it's going to take to get my life back together and it makes me even more impulsive and prone to gambling - thinking that it's the quick answer to a problem I can't possibly ever solve. I'm really pretty disgusted with myself to be honest. I just wonder, if any of you have experienced a similar impatience with recovering from this... what helps, if anything? I'm thinking about cashing my checks when they hit my account so I don't have access to it online.. Not too sure what I'm looking for here but would appreciate some advice/help. Thanks in advance."
135,1,Day 1Loss of words. Nothing to say .
136,1,"It's my birthday ... and I'm not gambling!!!!!Happy birthday to me!!  I've given myself the best birthday present ever.  For the first time in over a decade, I am not celebrating my birthday in a casino!!!  The sun is shining on the glistening snow outside my bedroom window.  I've just finished a glorious brunch that my husband prepared, my eldest son helped me open presents, my youngest son watched via Facetime and my cats cavorted in the boxes and wrapping.  I am relaxed and brimming with joy.  I spent time with my sweet, 99-year-old Dad yesterday and with my two older sisters. They thoroughly spoiled me with my favorite dessert and presents.  What a lovely birthday.  And I've missed 12 of them because of gambling.

This is such a big deal to me.  For so long, I escaped alone on my birthday.  I would ask my husband for money as gifts and then throw it away on the merciless, heartless casino industry. Please God let me never revert to that again.  I know how easy it would be to do it.

On my way home from my Dad's I had a moment where I was greatly tempted.  I came home and told my husband I wanted to go.  He did the best thing he could ever do.  He walked away and refused to engage in the conversation.  That was a gift because, in the past, those conversations often ended in me guilting him to give me money.

Today is only Day 28 and I realize that it is very early days and I have no illusions that this is a permanent change.  I accept that I can achieve this only one little day at a time.  For today, I am SOOO happy to be gambling free."
137,1,Day 23I haven‚Äôt even thought about checking the spreads even tho it‚Äôs 3 clicks away on my phone.   Enough was enough. Thank you to this community.
138,1,Day 6Depression is really starting to hit me hard. I just cant believe how much I've lost to gambling. The only thing helping me is going on walks when its nice out like today and everyones stories and kind words. You guys mean a lot to me. This Illinois weather is the worst. One day its beautiful out and im happy. The next day there is snow and negative -10 and I just sit inside and think about gambling. I just know that when I hit that 365 mark ill be better off even if i hadn't gambled.
139,1,"Day 1im hoping if I write this somewhere it will actually help me stop. so I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôve been gambling online, mainly slots since I was like 18. Started off with ¬£10 deposits and 20p bets and today I was doing ¬£40 spins. About a week ago I was kinda stupid and and deposited around ¬£500 and was doing ¬£10 spins. Ended up getting really lucky and winning 4000. Considering I had around 2000-3000 in my savings already I was pretty happy and said I‚Äôd take a break. I played again the next day. Lost a little but nothing major. The next day I end up depositing probably 1000 altogether, got lucky again and won 5000. So at this point I had 11,000 in my savings and was certain i wasn‚Äôt gonna gamble again. The day after I deposited 300 and made 600. Today I really fucked up and deposited 3,500 altogether. Started off with 200 but I just kept losing and upping my stake until I was doing ¬£40 spins. then by some fucking miracle I end up winning 4000 so now I‚Äôm back to where I started and I really don‚Äôt want it to happen again. so yeah day 1"

141,1,"Just day 1 &amp; I'm panicking about never gambling again!I am so sick of it, but I'm already getting anxious at the thought of not gambling again, I feel like I have (at least) 2 personalities that constantly fight against each other. I just told my SO for like the 3rd time in a year that I'm quitting today. And now I'm panicking because he's a great guy and I know he doesn't believe me, and every time I fail, my credibility goes south. I hate these mixed up feelings that drive me crazy.

When I decided to stop gambling on New Year‚Äôs Eve I felt so completely done with it, I wanted a life change, I was OVER it. And that feeling remains today. I am cautious, I know I am one bet away from chaos and despair and I clearly remember the pain, the scorching pain of loss, of losing my life savings to be exact. I still don‚Äôt want it anymore and I still feel very very VERY over it. My sanity, what little money I do have left and my mental &amp; physical health is priceless.

I recently did this and had my first session this past Friday. Therapy was great and helped understand how big this problem is. We are working on understanding why this happened and how we can shift our decision making processes.

The state pays for therapy but you do have to consent to share your demographic info. You do however stay anonymous.

152,1,Day 100!Today was the hardest day up to this point. I almost put money back on my casino account. Just as my bank account was loading up I cancelled it. I didn't even realise this was day 100 until I checked my reddit account to fight the urge to gamble again. I have had a lot of trouble not gambling the last week for some reason. I'm telling myself I can miss the money and that it wont hurt to gamble only 10 euro's but I'm certain that it'll soon turn into 100 and then 1000 etc. Proud of reaching 100 and turning off the the bank account in a weak moment. Keep grinding everyone!
153,1,Day 2Got all my gambling accounts suspended finally
154,1,Ffs went casinoI've been doing so well but ended up in the casino tonight and lost ¬£400. Frustrated with myself for doing this had literally been 6 months since I had gambled. Right now I won't to forget about the money and just don't want to gamble again but I'm just so angry at myself for this
155,1,"CravingsNeuroscience tells us how hard it is to intentionally refrain from something you are about to do. Buddhism tells us, yes, it's hard but do it anyway if you want to break the cycle of craving and attachment. If you can let yourself crave without grasping, even a few times, then  you can start to break down the automatic progression-that compelling momentum-that keeps the wheel going round and round. Then after a while, craving itself begins to diminish, because it's got nowhere to go."
156,1,Not Day 1 but Day 1...If you ever read my post you know I‚Äôve put myself thru so much shit and caused a lot of damage to my life and others gambling. I haven‚Äôt went to the casino in a while but I considered today day 1 because I‚Äôve broken even from debt pretty much I maybe have a $100 debt left but that‚Äôs nothing compared to the thousands I was in and almost letting my car get repossessed. The last time this happened I lasted about three months clean and lost my second job got depressed and went back to the casino with that extra time putting myself and a deeper whole than ever. I am now stable with two jobs right in time for my sons 3rd birthday in a few weeks And my sons mom is considering giving me another chance and being a family so it‚Äôs a start . I know the urges can comeback at anytime so I‚Äôm still letting my family members hold on to my identification unless I need it because that keeps me from entering the casino as I‚Äôm 27 but look young. Goodluck to everyone if you want to succeed make sure you tell someone and express to them how bad you really need help because only a gambler can understand how bad the addiction really is and hard to get over.
157,1,"Day 55 days of not gambling. Probably my longest since first starting in November. Its tough, it really is. Not really much to say at this point. I keep thinking about about burning all bridges and just moving far away and giving up. Sometimes I just want to rob a bank with a pretend gun just to go to jail and give up on life. Gambling had ruined me. 60k of debt and can't make ends meet. Credit is ruined. I have never missed a payment in my life but some how its below 600. I get that my debt to income ratio is way above normal but student loans shouldn't affect it but it does. Cant even get a payday loan to just help until May which is all I need. I make a lot in the summer as a ice sales driver its unreal. I just get hit with waves of depression that makes me think that life just isn't worth it anymore. Honestly nobody knows the real me at all. Not even my girlfriend of almost 4 years. Not even my family. All they see is a happy, tall, funny, college basketball player but they don't see the gambling addicted, depressed, low self-esteem person I am when alone. This is my only way of venting to the world for who I really am. I feel like such a burden in this world. I know that things will get better. No job around campus will take me because I graduate in May and being an RA I don't have time for anything. Grades slipping and nobody knows. Honestly at this point im just upset. There is no reason that money should make someone feel this way. See y'all tomorrow

158,1,"My dad is gambling and stole money from me.I have a complicated relationship with my dad. He works in Germany meanwhile me, my sister and mum live in Poland. He works there to earn more money.
He usualy visits us for 3-4 days in two months. When I was younger pauses were longer. One time he left us for about half a year and never explained what happend (my mom thinks he got in jail, but we really dont know for sure).
When I was a little kid I really loved him. I remember being so happy that he came to vistit one time. A few seconds he came in he took me in his arms and tossed info air a few times. I remember that moment very clearly, that was when he came after those six months, even now I can see my moms upset face.
He wouldnt send us money, so my mom was really stressed, and soon it turned out that she is bipolar. When I was seven she was forced i to a hospital. I started to grow more distant towards my dad, I didnt understand everything back then, but he would talk about mom badly, like she cant be trusted or is dangerous, so I was upset with him, but never really stood up to him. When my mom was in the hospital my grandad (from my moms side) would take care of me and my sister. This situation repated 4 times. 
I grew more and more distat until last summer. Right after my highschool finals i moved with him to Germany for work(I had to earn something to live on my own for college) . I was really bad. My manager was ksenofobic and really didnt like Poles. Plus that work was physsical, and Im just a thin girl. Anyway i worked there for three months. The company send the money to my dads bank account, bc If I would open an account I would have to pay for it. That was fine with me. I trusted my dad completly. When I got back to Poland he ave me money in cash and I just thought that I would make myself a bank accout for euro later.
Sadly, that was a huge mistake.
A week ago i asked him to send me more money, he said that he cant do it, and that he list his previous job, and now is working as a builder.
He didnt even say sorry to me.
I had 1500 euro on his account. I would peacfully live for this semestr to summer break, to go to work again. Now I have 30zlotych on my bank account and soon I will have to pay rent. I dont know what to to, I sent job applications everywhere, and only one place called me back(I applied to be a waistress). The recrutier told me that its a strip club. And when I got outside I just started to bawl my eyes out. How did I get here? 
I really dont know why he did that to me, I trusted him, and really belived that he changed.
Tell me please, do you think that he still cares about me? That he loves me? I dont even know what to say to him when I meet him. Im not even angry at him, just so hurt that my own dad got me in this situation.
Please tell me if you were in a similar situation, and what did you did/felt. Also I would like to understand just why he did that. I would want someone to explain it to me please. When I just think about that he doesnt care about me I start crying and cant think straight."
159,1,"I have the best luck with the worst mindset.I cleared my debt in November from years and had $8000 in savings by Feb. I turned each $1000 to $4000-7000 and withdrew to my bank account.

I didn't spend a single dollar on myself and just felt happy and more productive at work feeling like a winner, always high for a while.

It got so bad, as soon as I wake up, I'd quick high limit roulette, during work on phone and before sleep for hours daily. I just kept working and gambling on phone. 

Any time, not gambling made me just feel empty , so any little win on roulette of $400 made me happy for few hours( drug feeling?) 


To cut it short, I'm only left with $1200 savings. What could have been $25000-40000 in winnings in a month. I realized, literally have zero willpower, patience and respect for the money.


I'm not even sad or see this as addiction now. More like a drug that feeds me to be productive for few hours. 

How do I become happy without it and respect the money?

I have no debt and my grocery etc bills are always paid on time. 


Another reason I gamble is because if I don't then it sends me in depression state thinking of my fiance that I dated for 7+ years. If I gamble then I don't think about her and this just feeds me happiness. I went on a few dates and didn't find anything interesting about them, so didn't waste their time for going further. 


I guess my battle is inside for not being happy about ex, and I gamble for that. If I don't gamble, my brain shuts off except thing about her."

About 4 years ago I ran up about 6k in credit card debt lied to my wife that it was work and vehicle expenses that came up since it was my personal card that I had for years. We paid that off with savings and I completely stopped gambling. I hadn‚Äôt touched a casino for 4 years. Recently gambling became legal online in my area. I promptly set up accounts and ran up another 7k in debt. I think what kicked off this new cycle was that right before the casinos opened, I decided I would try my hand at leverage trading since we had been established a nice savings account. I promptly lost 12k doing that and in my mind I could gamble to get that back (even though I realize now I was gambling with the leverage trading) At the end of the day I‚Äôm not broken financially but I know that it needs to stop here or there won‚Äôt be any way out.

167,1,"Cognitive Dissonance in AddictionMy name is Russ and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. One of the recent Problem Gambling Support Group meetings I attended via Skype had this fantastic topic for us to discuss as a group. I loved the topic so much I said to the person who was chairing I‚Äôll have to write a blog on this. That person knows who they are and I just want to say I am proud of you and your journey so far.

**Cognitive Dissonance in Addiction**

*It is rare for an addict to realize they have a problem, and stop the behaviour right then and there. Cognitive dissonance is an incompatibility between one's beliefs and desires or behaviours which causes extreme anxiety and discomfort. A gambler who recognizes their gambling has become harmful and continues to gamble experiences cognitive dissonance. In theory, dissonance reduction requires either our beliefs or behaviour to change. Generally, addicts take the path of least resistance. Our beliefs change and morph to accommodate our addictive behaviours.*

***1) At what point in your active addiction did you realize you had a problem? Did this create within you a sense of internal conflict?***

I honestly believe the first time I realised I had a problem was on April 2nd 2019 which was the date of my last bet. That‚Äôs when I honestly said to myself that I have a problem and need help, then told my partner. Now, in saying that, there are a hell of a lot of red flags that I can talk about when looking back that should have been enough for me to realise I had a problem.

Spending hours of my time gambling is the one I will start off with, hours on end gambling online or when I was working spending my full lunch hour standing in a bookies. Sitting up until 3am or 4am betting on some shite tennis in Asia between two players no one has ever heard of. Not even anyone watching it at the court, there‚Äôs me streaming it and betting on it. When I would constantly gamble when out and about either with my family or when I was out with friends, I couldn‚Äôt do anything without my head being in my phone. So yeah, time spent on gambling should have been enough alone to make me realise.

Obviously the amount of money I was spending was an issue but more than that it was the fact I was borrowing money so I could gamble. More and more debt was being added simply so I could gamble. When I ran out of options to gamble from companies I started borrowing from friends and family, I even stole from the fantasy leagues that I run! That was crossing so many lines that I should have realised at that point but I didn‚Äôt want to. I wanted to continue gambling.

I would cool off, self exclude, withdraw after I won whatever ‚Äúresponsible gambling‚Äù measures there are I tried them but obviously I was so far past that stage that they were completely useless. I remember self excluding from Bet365 and Betfair for 5 years each and literally counting down the days until I could reopen them. The amount of times I withdrew from a bookmaker only to reverse the withdrawal and lose it all, I mean, countless times. I know that‚Äôs a familiar story for a lot of online gamblers and I hated it when I did it. So much so in fact that I stopped betting with bookmakers that I knew you could reverse the withdrawal. Instead, on the other sites, I would withdraw then sit and wait for it to hit my account so I could deposit it again.

Finally I will touch on this, and it‚Äôs not something I am proud of but it is simply a fact of how I felt back then. I loved gambling more than anything else in the whole wide world, more than my kids, my partner, my parents, my friends, my job, the list is endless. Gambling was the number one thing in my life and when that happens, when that is how strongly I felt about gambling, I should have realised I had a problem and needed help. Instead it took me until I was mentally broken to finally enter recovery.

***2) After realizing you had a problem and before entering recovery, did you convince yourself that your behaviour was justifiable/excusable?***

Again, because I feel like I had a problem and entered recovery at the same time I will share how I justified or explained my behaviour to myself when I was gambling. So I have time, money, responsible gambling and relationships.

Time wise I justified it that I was using my own down time to gamble and it wasn‚Äôt impacting on any other aspects of my life. This was clearly bollocks since I was gambling every minute I was in work, I have no idea how I have a job to be honest. I gambled non stop at home, but I will get to that when talking about relationships.

When it came to money it was easy to justify, it was my money! Only it wasn‚Äôt was it? I was spending money that could have been used on my kids or my partner. I was borrowing money that wasn‚Äôt mine to gamble or to replace money lost by gambling. Any money I borrowed was always paid back, well to friends and family anyways, until it wasn‚Äôt. Until I borrowed too much and couldn‚Äôt pay it back. Then I would lie and make up excuses or try to borrow more. I stole money from my partner when I used our savings to gamble. It wasn‚Äôt a lot of money but that isn‚Äôt the point, it‚Äôs the fact that I took that money, which was ours and didn‚Äôt ask her. That‚Äôs stealing but in my head I was just borrowing.

I would tell myself I could control my gambling, that I was in control. Sure I even self excluded from websites and I would use cooling off periods. I even stopped gambling for periods of time, a few weeks, a few months, nearly a year at one point. I always went back though because I was stopping because I had to. Either lack of money or I thought I was going to get found out. Debts needed paid that I couldn‚Äôt hide. I always felt that I was in control but in all honesty I was controlled by gambling.

Last but not least, relationships, and my justification was simple for this one, I was not hurting anyone with my behaviour. How could my kids or my partner be hurt by me gambling? It didn‚Äôt make sense to me, and again being totally honest it has only started to make sense to me in the last few weeks where I have had the opportunity through the GamCare chat room to be able to talk to spouses of compulsive gamblers. I now see the hurt that I have caused those closest to me, and I probably can‚Äôt see all of it. Shouting at my kids for no reason other than the fact I was having a bad day or had no money left to gamble. Making them feel like shit because I felt like shit. Letting my relationship with my partner fall apart to point it might never recover to what it used to be. As she told me recently, ‚Äúyou are so in touch with your emotions recently but you didn‚Äôt give a fuck about mine while you were sitting up all night doing what you were doing.‚Äù She‚Äôs not fucking wrong either. I barely spoke to my parents when I dropped my kids round for them to look after, I was too busy on my phone or thinking about gambling. I went round to their house a week or two after entering recovery and had a cup of coffee and they said to me it‚Äôs the most I have spoken to them in ages.

***3) What happened to make you realize you needed to change your behaviour? What happened to your beliefs at that time?***

I was mentally broken by gambling and I could sense my brain was flying me towards self destruction. April 2nd 2019 I was sitting in work, looking miserable, trying to work out how I would fix everything and my mate asked me if I was ok. It was the first time I said no, not really. So he said let‚Äôs go for a drink at lunchtime and it was the first time I opened up to someone about what I was going through. It was at that point I realised I needed to change my behaviour. Not just change my behaviour but change everything about my life. I was a mess and it was because of gambling. I didn‚Äôt know how or what I would do but I knew I needed to do something. All my bullshit reasons to justify my behaviours and actions were proven to be just that...bullshit. I knew I had to tell my partner and I was fucking terrified. I assumed she would kick me out of the house, I wouldn‚Äôt see my kids all the time, I had all these thoughts going through my head about what would happen and it was obviously all the worst possible scenario. Another thing I knew was that if I came out about this I would lose the one thing I loved the most and that wasn‚Äôt my two kids or my partner, that was gambling. That also terrified me. My mind was racing but I knew what I had to do. I realised my beliefs were totally fucked up and I realised that I was lying to myself. I was miserable and I needed help. I needed to stop digging, put the fucking shovel down and reach out for help.

I absolutely loved this topic and it really gives me plenty to think about when writing about it and for that I am grateful. I‚Äôm really enjoying the Brothers Osbourne at the moment and they have a song called ‚ÄúIt Ain‚Äôt My Fault‚Äù. Although it has nothing to do with addiction the song reminds me of the sort of thinking I would have after I fucked up...again.

*‚ÄúI got my hands up*

*I need an alibi*

*Find me a witness who can testify*

*You made a mistake*

*You got the wrong guy*

*I'm only guilty of a damn good time*

*No it ain't my fault‚Äù*

168,1,"Day 4I constantly wake up thinking that this can‚Äôt be real. There‚Äôs no way that I lost all my money and have to beg for money. I have a plan set up but still can‚Äôt think about the loses I had. Constantly thinking about time travel and thinking about the what ifs. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that day in November when I begged someone to hook me up with this gambling site. Next thing I know 4 months later I‚Äôm down 20-30k. Can‚Äôt stop thinking about parlays I could‚Äôve made that would have won me millions. I don‚Äôt think about winning the lottery ever. That‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve never cared about. I pray that no one ever goes through this. I pray everyday that people who are worse than me can recover from this sick addiction. I hope that whoever is reading this that hasn‚Äôt gambled yet or just started realizes what a sick and crippling thing gambling is. Still no urge to gamble. Thank you to everyone who post about their stories. To those who shares their stores, you have literally helped me so much. You guys have brought light into my life. To everyone with this addiction, please don‚Äôt give up fighting. As long as you guys stay strong, I will be with you the whole way.

169,1,"Day 60-70I‚Äôve been keeping myself busy with work and a new hobby (cycling) so I haven‚Äôt been able to post. Had a few bumpy days and one really bad stressful day where the urge was almost unbearably strong. Thankfully I‚Äôve self excluded online and at my two local casinos because I was so ready to jump ship. I was able to gain some important perspective though. Gambling really is my go-to escape for problems at home or pressures at work. It‚Äôs crazy how my mind just automatically goes in that direction when I‚Äôm under a lot of stress. I don‚Äôt have the answer in how to retrain that response or even a healthier option to replace gambling as of yet, but the longer I‚Äôm clean, the better my chances are at eventually figuring this out. The only hard fact of gambling is that it‚Äôll only make my problems worse even if it provides a momentary escape. Hang tight everyone. I‚Äôm rooting for all of us."

I am a 42 year old male, unhappily married as most men,  l have two daughters aged 6, 3 months. My gambling journey began in 2001 and my losses are in the 6 figures.  Gambling has taken so much from me, the monetary losses l can handle but when something strips away your dignity, that's far more damaging. The best way to describe it is by taking the Shakespearian route, I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial."

I think after 3 days I finally realize how bad this addiction is. Not to just me, but to America its self. Yeah people win big money and thats obviously how casinos advertise, but you take all the big wins and big losses together and America pays in millions almost billions to these casinos. Im a senior in college and just got a job that will pay around 40-50k a year with 60k in debt. My goal is to pay it off in 2022.

190,1,"Recommended Ways to Stop Gambling...Recommended ways to avoid the first bet: a collaboration of experience
Going into gambling establishments (for any reason) is a HUGE risk and one you don‚Äôt need to take. Toilets, food and drink can be found elsewhere and self-exclusion can be accomplished on-line.
Avoid carrying money as much as possible: some members use a single card so that their partners/family/friends can keep track of where the money is spent; others get receipts; in this way everything can be accounted for.
Make sure you attend GA meetings regularly and frequently: at least once a week, but in the early days you will really appreciate more.
Barriers are extremely useful, the more hurdles you have to jump before being ‚Äúable‚Äù to bet, the less likely you are do it.
Let your loved ones know about ALL debts! This can seem a horrendous task to the new member, but read Page 18 of ‚ÄúTowards 90 days‚Äù, it will explain more.
Every day, first thing in the morning, look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you will not gamble that day and congratulate yourself each night if you don‚Äôt.
Register with online self-exclusion schemes, this makes it EXTREMELY difficult to place a bet even when your addiction wants you to.
Share ‚Äì The more you can tell the GA room, the more the room can help you. Remember, there will likely be someone in the room that has lived through what you are experiencing.
Avoid ways of getting hold of money secretly; this includes handing over your I.D. (to avoid withdrawing money over the counter in-branch). Sometimes it can even mean handing over anything you could pawn; like jewellery and log-books to cars.
Never have access to accounts you don‚Äôt need access to; this includes knowing login details to online banking
One call or text is all it takes to speak to another G.A. member.
Not sure if something is right?: ask! If you have a question, phone someone; text someone; it is
not advisable to wait until your next meeting.
Your addiction wants secrecy and solitude! Try not to give yourself time and opportunity to
gamble, this can mean keeping loved ones informed of where you are and how long you‚Äôll be there etc.
Make sure you cancel any running bets and close all betting accounts. (having a partner a family member present while doing this will help avoid a slip here).
Only you know how conniving and devious you were, adopt as many safeguards as possible to counteract this.
Unhappy with life?: give us just six weeks. In just 6 weeks attending G.A. we believe your life will have changed dramatically for the better; after all, what have you got to lose?
Someone strong ‚Äì Handing over your finances to a loved one that will forcefully question why you ‚Äúneed‚Äù money will really help you. Not being trusted with money is hard but very beneficial at the beginning. No-one is saying this is forever."
191,1,"Day 1 (again)Posted on here exactly 2 months ago. So far I have relapsed twice. Down $1600 total this year. Very very disappointed in myself and my 2 trips to the casino.

Third time is a charm. I am absolutely 100% determined to go 6 months gamble free. All money is going into my wife‚Äôs bank account and after 6 months we are using that significant chunk of money to put down on a house in September. I have noticed the longer I quit, the more I hate gambling.

But I‚Äôm finding when I keep it to myself, I can justify and think about it however I see fit which inevitably leads back to gambling. Admitting my problem to my friend was exactly what I needed to come to terms with it for myself.

197,1,"Sometimes I shock myselfStill Day 24:  I spent today struggling to put the lid on Pandora's box. After an epic argument with my husband last night, I was hell-bent on going out to gamble.  I imagined being there, the smells and sounds and I was hooked.  I told my husband of my struggle and he asked what tools I was given in my years of gambling therapy.  I remembered the usual.  Don't allow yourself to be Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired (HALT). But the one that helped me today and the best bit of advice ever is ""play the movie to the end"".  
So, here is how my movie ended:  
A desperate woman in a gaudy bingo hall, hopping from slot machine to slot machine, aching for the relief of those three bonus symbols.  That ""sweet relief"" of ""10 free games"".  On other visits, seeing those words, my entire body would sag with relief and I would mutter under my breath ""big, big, big"", like an incantation forcing the machine to my will. And then I would do the unthinkable --rub my flattened hand across the screen, caressing a big win from the machine.  Years ago, I used to laugh at people like me.   
But on this last night, no amount of urging, internal praying, cajoling the Universe would give me a bonus.  No relief.  I ran from atm to atm, hot and flustered, stealing money that belonged to my household.  Every dollar meant a measure of hardship for the coming month.  I COULDN'T stop.  I was like an automaton, wearing a path in the ugly carpets from ATM to slot machine.  I despised myself.  I was sick in the pit of my stomach.    
As I walked out, unfulfilled, depressed, on the verge of tears, I suddenly stopped in the parking lot.  Back in I went, marched to the manager's office and went through the humiliation of self-excluding, again.  And then the trip home. Praying ... asking God, just once more, don't let my husband look at the bank accounts or find out that I snuck out tonight and I promise I will stop gambling.  The bargain was kept and I was fine for 24 days.  And it will be kept this night as I vividly remember that sad, strange creature, looking slightly crazed.  
Thank you, Reddit, for this subreddit.  Getting this out of my head tonight has helped immeasurably.  If you read to this point, thank you for your indulgence."

My debt is not as bad as others here... But I just had so many opportunities to get ahead and I didn't. I am living alone and self-employed and taxes are catching up with me. Everything falls on me now. People here are very right when they say that this isn't something we do that's fun, we do it to punish ourselves. It's another form of self-harm truly. I used to physically self harm . This is much worse. 

I quit smoking weed by telling myself that I didn't deserve to feel so shitty all the time. And just like that I also don't deserve to feel shitty from gambling either. It's not that we can't handle the negative consequences, you can always rebuild your life. it's that we don't deserve these negative consequences we deserve self-love."

204,1,"working toward Day 1hey there, new here, and relatively new to gambling. 

I started playing online casino games last fall, and with a lucky start, really did well for a while. 

my husband and I are in a considerable amount of debt, from different life circumstances, so the ‚Äúwon money‚Äù was helping with bills and gave us the freedom to do things we wouldn‚Äôt normally have been able to do. 

it wasn‚Äôt long before that luck ran out, and I started to play merely to recoup losses. and then the hole got bigger, and bigger. all of a sudden i was spending my friday paycheck before the weekend was even over, trying to ‚Äúturn it into more.‚Äù I did have good intentions. or so I thought. I wanted to help us get out of debt quicker, and in turn made it much worse. 

within the last two months, I have begun to switch any and all bills possible that were auto-deducting from my bank account, to be paid by credit card, so I had more to gamble with. then, twice in the past month I found myself having played away money I needed to pay a credit card. in the 11+ years I‚Äôve had credit, I‚Äôve never paid anything late. I‚Äôm really ashamed of myself and my behavior, and I want it to stop. 

I had a total breakdown, heart to heart, open confession session with my husband this weekend. obviously he‚Äôs known I‚Äôve been playing, just didn‚Äôt know how bad it‚Äôs grip on me had become. the intelligent, responsible, careful person he knew had been replaced with a delusional idiot. he‚Äôs worried about me, and I am too. with mental health issues that have led to hospitalization in the past, the risk of either mania or depression having any role or effect from this are high. I don‚Äôt currently have a therapist, just a psychiatrist, and don‚Äôt have the funds for one, but know these are things I really need to be talking about with a professional. 

a week or so ago, I started listening to the After Gambling podcast, started reading posts on this sub. I feel positive that there is hope, and yet, I still don‚Äôt have a day 1. I know it‚Äôs a journey, but damn, when will I finally say enough is enough?"

Some good ones for me are 

1. A paycheque = winning back losses 
2. Lost money is gone and its not coming back 
3. Other people have issues where they need to give away money for sickness or disability our just happens to be addictior
4. Cut expenses to get back lost money

Today I finally lost a sports bet (after a lucky streak) and had a rush to win it right back. So of course I try to play some BJ. I managed to gave it all away.. But leave with what I originally deposited before suspending my account.

I always have an Impulse to chase and try to win it right back. And it always ends up the same way. Sure it works at times. But I'll just end up losing it all another time.


I am Tired of staying up late watching games and not doing anything productive. I have exams this week... What am I doing watching TV for a rush. 

I am in no way in any financial trouble. I am lucky to have the wealth that I have. 
The fact that the stock market is taking a hit isn't helping my morale...

213,1,"My own greed and isolation ruined my life\*warning discusses money\*

I had a lot of stability in my life with a good paying job. I worked hard to save my money and grinded for 6 years to save up. When in my early 20s, I was putting 30% of my pay check in my 401k to max it out, had an index fund portfolio, roth account,  and was aggressively paying off my car loan all at the same time. Got a roommate for a few years to minimize living expenses..etc. Still remember all of the long days I pulled at work. All seems like it was for nothing now. Things were going well until I discovered options trading.

I started trading options on the side 3 years ago and when I started I was responsible, just setting aside $2.5k which was a small amount of my savings at the time. It hurts reflect on what Im about to type next..well I got lucky with several plays and I wish I never did. I transformed that $2.5k into $20k over the course of a few weeks. I was smart at first...I realized that it was not sustainable so i took my profit..bam up close to 10x for little effort. Fast forward a few months later, I was having a hard time at work and I was getting tired of the grind. I thought I would dive back into options again. This time, I took $10k to play with since it was still house money. It was slow for a while, mostly just trading chops in the market..and then I got lucky again. I went all in on a position with the $10k which netted out $275k in return in less than a month. It blew my mind. I decided that I needed a break from work and left. Again...stupid me didnt realize these gains. Of course my roommate asked what was up since I wasnt going to work, so I showed him what I did. In my mind, I had $275k in ""capital"" in addition to the  my savings account and my 401k with no debts whatsoever.

I kind of just was existing while unemployed. Didnt do much at all. My skills were stagnating and all I cared about was my profit. I told people I had a business but it was all bullshit. For months I did exactly this..and as the isolation cornered me I lost myself. The gains from my big wins started to vanish as mistakes were made. I couldnt think logically being alone and immersed in this reclusive world of lies so I started dipping into my savings. I was funneling thousands into options which netted no returns. My impatience grew and I really started doing wreckless things. When it was all said and done, my savings were gone in their entirety from losses and living expenses. I was also using margin to funnel more money in. It got to the point where I was trading my remaining funds for rent and borrowed funds  just to try to raise money faster. I got in the hole 5 figures of debt from margin. I had no choice but to pay it off with my retirement money. Had a mental breakdown and turned to alcohol. Was too ashamed to tell anyone anything.

Im going on 30 now and I look back on my 20s asking myself where did it all go wrong. I no longer have any friends, havent told the extend of damage to my family, and really feel lost. Ive been living out of airbnbs for a while, directionless and hopeless. Its impacted my day to day with everything, and my new job has been tough. I managed to save up money in my savings since, along with $5k in my new retirement account, but my perception of money is forever fucked. I am seriously behind for retirement now, all the while the market  back then was in a once in a lifetime bullrun from 2012-recently and I have nothing to show for it. With this coronavirus stuff going on, the market will now likely work against me as I try to salvage my retirement. Just want this nightmare to end. I have nothing. I go to work and come home. Wake up, live a lie. I am sorry for everything I did and letting everyone down.

But somehow, after a horrible, nightmarish night of gambling, I once again said ""enough!""  I self-excluded from the awful bingo hall where I played slots exclusively because I am self-excluded from casinos.  The banning did it.  I put a blocker on my laptop and just need one on my phone now to be completely blocked everywhere.  Waiting for a bit of spare money to do that.  
Still, after all that, I had a big argument with my husband tonight and seriously contemplated sneaking into one of the bingo hovels.  I battled mightily in my brain and finally won.

I‚Äôm beyond lucky and grateful for him. Well today we looked at a house and decided to put an offer on it. We have to rely 100% on him for his good credit, financing and the down payment.

I‚Äôm not counting days, as counting days seems to me like reminding me of what gambling did and brought, good and bad. I prefere not counting it, seems more natural to not remember how much time has gone since I didn‚Äôt place a bet. I think forgetting all about it and living without it is more natural when you don‚Äôt have a count of how much time ago I was like that. Don‚Äôt know if I explained it thoroughly and if you get what I wanted to point out. Thing is that, in essence, all you have to do is be.

Hope everything‚Äôs well with you, and I‚Äôm happy to share that I don‚Äôt look at my debts as dramatically as I looked at them to be. Everything‚Äôs going to be fine. 

Didn‚Äôt have panic attacks and anxiety for some time now and it feels great. No bad thoughts, no suicidal urges, no nothing. Reconnecting with old friends and telling them everything and getting the support I had from them was amazing as well.

224,1,"Day 0... but somethings clicking...So I did gamble today but then I stumbled upon the After Gambling podcast and heard some stories and realized that we are all the same. We all say the exact same thing to ourselves ‚ÄúThis next one is the big one‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I won back my losses id stop‚Äù


Well that last one hits hard for me... I hate gambling but I hate losing money even more. So I chased and chased and almost had it about 4-5 times (near miss is also in sports betting) I accepted the money is gone... heres what‚Äôs helping me not sure if itll help you or if its just the gambling mentality in me. Besides this sub, reading &amp; podcasts ive been telling myself this to cope with losses

I make +1k a week.through my job 

I will win 1k for a week for the next 25 weeks to recoup my losses. 

I dont know if this makes sense or if thats a bad mindset to have but its helping me deal with the lost money. Around 25-27k"

At lunchtime today I canceled the withdrawal and decided to play well I just lost every single cent I feel like I‚Äôm going to puke I have three little children and a beautiful wife and I have this terrible sickness that I hide from them and cannot overcome.

Today was horrible. There is a popular saying that I remember from this subreddit: the highs are high, but the lows are low. All the poor slept nights have started to catch up and no amount of sugar or caffeine is going to help me. I can't do anything. I am waiting for chemicals in my brain to recalibrate at least sufficiently enough so that I can hit the gym. I am eating poorly and I feel sluggish.

229,1,"What do I do?Hello everyone,

Lol im 24 and don't even understand reddit. Hopefully im doing this right but here goes. I am a senior in college at 24. Straight up, I have a really bad gambling addiction. Im 14k in CC debt. 5k in personal loans. Maxed out all my credit cards. Spent all my money with 500 a month of bills. Honestly I don't even know what to do with myself. I thought about offing my self but I don't have the balls for it. My girlfriend doesn't even know, and I want to leave her so she doesn't have to deal with this. I cant get a bankruptcy because if we get a house she will know. The easy step is to not gamble, because you cant gamble if you have no money. I think im 26k in debt to gambling. 14k in just the last 2 months so that pretty OP if you ask me. The only thing I can think of doing at this point is break up with my girlfriend, work at my summer job at home, save money, move far away, get a full time job, eat spaghetti everyday with maybe some rice and beans every now and then, and pay off my $63K in debt as fast as I can. Then what, look to see that my ex girlfriend is making over 100k. (backstory, she's in the top1% of her class and is a psych major with people begging her to work for them). I love her but she doesn't deserve this. Anyway, I have no one to talk to and I don't even know if I'm doing this reddit thing right."

Firstly, this sub has been a huge initiator for me to take that first step in getting rid of my addictional behavior. Thank you!

I should be on day 139 currently. I have relapsed numerous times though and this eventually eats you up inside. My day 1-s did not work as I just lied to myself. I just kept making up excuses.

Being highly demotivated ja frustrated, I decided to open up to the internet. So I created a blog to write down, document and share my journey. As I do not know what really works for me in this situation, it might help me and hopefully someone else too. I am not a writer nor a native english speaker. But writing keeps me distracted and going and most of all, it keeps me responsible.

You can access it from here - www.broke.money

Have a look around and see if this might help you even a tiny bit getting out of the hole. I am currently around 3 500 eur in debt so some of you might relate to this starting position better. Plan is to post once a week plus the monthly financial overview.

Wishing each and every one part of this sub a speedy recovery and thanks for the support!"

241,1,"Hello AllHey guys, just found this subreddit and I need some help.

Just to give some background and get straight to it, I'm addicted to Gacha mobile games. I've shamefully spent more then 20k for literal digital items. My wife was devastated when she found out. I've since deleted all the games off my phone so I wasn't easily tempted. 

It's been almost a month now since I've played anything in general. I've been trying to fill my time by doing other things, I've watched new TV shows, read a book, worked on the car, clean and reorganize the house etc. but my wife is rightfully still skeptical and thinks I might fall back into my old ways. I've broke her trust and it breaks my heart. 

I keep going over in my head all the things we could of did with the money I spent and every time I start thinking about it I instantly shut down and I get frustrated with myself.

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated, I honestly don't know what to do with myself.

Thanks in advance



Edit: Just a quick update, last night I went to my first meeting, I felt extremely nervous, and completely embarrassed. When I walked into the room the gentleman that ran the meeting asked me if I was my first time coming to a meeting and I said yes. He then walked me out of the room into the hallway to kind of put me at ease and explain how the meetings typically worked and then we walked back in the room. After hearing a few people talk it was finally my turn and I felt uncomfortable and again... embarrassed but no one judged me and everyone had kind words and suggestions. At the end of the meeting I was assigned a sponsor and he's supposed to reach out to me some time today to follow up. 

To all those that are on the fence about going to a meeting, I'd absolutely recommend going. Obviously I saw no immediate progress but just being there and hearing what others have to say and suggest really did help me out and and it put some things in perspective for me. Meetings for me are every Tuesday and Thursday so I'll be going back tomorrow night."

243,1,"Day 1*24 February 2020*

Once again I find myself in the position to write about this horrible addiction. During the past three weeks I have gone through a gambling spree in which I have lost once again a consistent amount of money. Not only that I have loaned money from banks and other institutions, but this time I was so desperate that I used money that do not belong to me. There is a friend of mine that helped me cover that hole, but I should not have access to that money and I am currently working on this issue.

It's the same story every time. I decide that I suddently have control over the addiction. The past is just the past. I make one small wager. I lose. I want to win the money back and then I will stop. I make the money back. I lose. I lose some more. I lose until I have nothing more to lose. The cycle is never ending. When I am activated by the addiction, I am a completely different person. I have 0 focus at work and barely give any effort. I try to avoid human connection as much as possible. I am becoming anti-social. I refuse invitations to go out with my friends. I am barely staying inside the house also. I quit going to the gym. I drink soda like a maniac. Every single bad habit that I am trying to remove is reactivated as well. It's like there are two completely different individuals living in the same body. The end is always the same. Money is lost. Depression sets. Urges come from time to time.

This time I have decided to write more about how I am feeling. Right now I am feeling a little bit hopeless. I know that the lows are low, but it really feels like shit. The existing barriers are not enough. Complacency makes gambling possible. I have not yet completely internalized that this is a serious health issue, a dangerous addiction. Maybe sharing my story will help me find myself again.

It's Day 1 once again. I deserve better than this. You deserve better than this."

For the last 20 days, I'm more in tune into all of lifes issues and annoyances.  Overall, even with that, I find myself much happier, calmer, sleeping better, so no complaints on my end.

This wasn‚Äôt very often but I knew I just wasn‚Äôt a great gambler. More recently I tried out some online slots and would have some small limits. Over the past few weeks I took a few $50 bets and made over $3000.

I think this got to my head and make me crave that win and keep thinking I could do it again. So once again I turned a $50 bet into $1000.  Then I found myself gambling daily. When you win it doesn‚Äôt seem like a problem. Over the past weekend I‚Äôve netted $1650 just on online slots.

Then today I tried to win more - during work hours. Which just feels awful. Of course I lost so I kept betting more $100 deposit at a time. Now it‚Äôs the end of the day and my few hundred dollars of deposits are actually $1900.

My previous $1650 winnings haven‚Äôt cashed out yet so it isn‚Äôt a total loss of my money but man what a terrible feeling to have lost so much in such a short time. I‚Äôve decided to setup deposit limits on the sites and pausing accounts for 6 months where I could

I find myself thinking about them around 9pm some nights, because this was the end of the bingo, this is where we would desperately shove as much money as possible in the slot machines before they threw us out at 10pm. We had a laugh and we all got really excited when one of us triggered the community bonus and we all had the bonus up together. I also think about us moaning ‚Äúthis machine is shit‚Äù or ‚Äúit must be paying out soon‚Äù etc. I wonder if they still go every night and if they‚Äôve done any good. I feel sorry for them too.

In the beginning of recovery it was easier to listen to podcasts, audible books and post here. I had my anonymity and got a lot of things off my chest. All these things were my starter recovery tool kit.   These were my only tools against addiction.  They were baby steps and the pace I was comfortable with up until the end of January, I was still holding out on talking to my spouse. Still scared to attend the Problem Gambling Skype group and going to GA. 

The beginning of this month I stepped on the gas pedal to recovery!  I came clean to my husband, I attended my first Skype meeting last week and this past Thursday went to my first GA meeting. WOW!  I feel like a recovery machine. I think my gambling addiction has switched to recovery addiction and it feels good. I was so scared of doing those 3 things and after I did them, I felt so much better.  Everyone in GA was so welcoming.  And I spoke and shared a lot more than I thought. Because it was scary to actually speak out loud and tell my story to strangers. But It was liberating.  these strangers knew exactly my pain. 

I also found it interesting that people were there with 20+years and I was like wow. I guess I assumed you would graduate and move on and stop going to meetings. But they keep going because one urge can set u back. Because they want to help others that need their help. I see now that this will be a lifelong membership and I‚Äôm looking forward now to it and taking more steps toward recovery."

274,1,"Commitment to Stopping (AGAIN)Hey guys, I know better than what I've done the last few weeks but I feel like I need to post if not to help anyone else at least get this shit off my chest. 

I think today is my cake day which means my first post or lurk on reddit was a year ago, and I made an account because of this sub as you can tell by the name, long time gambler and struggling recovering addict. I've been gambling for 10 years ranging from poker, to table games but mostly sports betting. 

A year ago I checked into my first GA meeting, got a sponsor, went about 120 days and then relapsed and stopped going. This spiraled as you can imagine, but I got better. I stopped gambling again. On top of gambling I've had other addictions to weed out. Being a poly addict sucks and usually when one flares the others do, but thankfully I've kept those in check for 4 months now. 

Anyway I used to bet big money, money I didn't have, and it's caused me to max out all of my credit cards, still having trouble making a dent paying them back, but not only that, I think it really desensitized me to money. I started working a second job doing Postmates recently to try to get some extra income and it's been going well, I finally had a full week where my bank account wasn't negative collecting overdraft fees, and what do I go and do? Lose $350. This is a small number for me relative to my old losses but it really feels like a gut jab because one, I don't have it, and two, it makes my hard work feel like absolutely nothing. I really have been trying to gain perspective on money lately and appreciate the dollar, as it's been tough for me to do when you're having 5k swings on sports it's a bit desensitizing when you think about $5, $50, even $100, but now that I've slowed down these all feel like a lot more than they have in the past. I guess that is a good thing, and a positive to take from all of this is that I do value money more now. Even the smaller amounts. This $350 I lost will hopefully be the last for a long time, one day at a time. I know I'll figure out how to pay my bookie by Wednesday, I just hate that I've put myself here yet again.

286,1,Day 7Compulsive gambler for 2 years lost over $25k . Stopped a week ago after terrible loss of $12k . Dont have debt but had $50 to my name last week. Today is friday just got paid had few urges but trying to fight  it. Proud of myself .
287,1,Day 12Feels much better
288,1,Day 147
289,1,"Today is day 1Throwaway account ...

I'm writing this as a reminder to myself - The only winner in gambling is the establishment, never me, the wins just cover up the massive losses.

In 6 months, I have withdrawn over $320,000 from my 401k.  That's 20 years of putting $$ into that 401k.  Some of this money went to home improvements, probably 25k or so, the rest...  gone..   

I've been avoiding doing my taxes because I knew I'd have to pay an early withdrawal fee 10%, but the thing is 25% of that money went to taxes, that comes out automatically during withdrawal, but that amount of withdrawn money puts me in a higher tax bracket, so over a certain amount, that $ is now taxed higher than 25% and I have to pay that additional amount..  From what I can tell via Turbotax, right now I owe \~80k in taxes and fees.  I still have enough left in my 401k to pay this off (plus the taxes) but that pretty much leaves me with 0 retirement money.

Then, I'll have to pay taxes on that 80k next year and won't have any $ left in the 401k, so don't know what I'll do.

Why do I always F myself over.

I feel so low"
290,1,Day 15I started to feel good again. I think about my kids more and how I‚Äôm so selfish.  All the time and money I could spend on my kids. I feel like crying right now. Just cut up all my credit cards. Gambling is a fucking nightmare. Just for today.
291,1,"A-Z of My Story So FarMy name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. I have a lot of things on my mind right now, although the urge or thought to gamble isn‚Äôt one of them, and I feel like I have a lot to say but just need time to figure it out. I think my head is a bit all over the place and I want to tackle various issues at once instead of taking a step back and approaching it one at a time. So I thought that an A-Z of my journey so far, life, gambling and recovery, might give me an opportunity to touch on various things just a little and maybe allow some of the thoughts I have to escape.

A is for Abstinence - There is a huge difference in my mind between abstinence and recovery as abstinence simply involves stopping gambling. Now, for some that may be enough to stay away for the rest of their lives and that is fantastic, but for me, I knew through experience it wouldn‚Äôt be enough. I have tried to stop on my own in the past and eventually my ‚Äúwill power‚Äù ended and I went right back. I was never actually trying to become a better person or trying to learn a better way to live, I was simply stopping gambling in the hope that everything would fix itself which was never going to be enough. Now, abstinence is vital for my recovery because I need to stop gambling but I have done, and continue to do, so much more than just stopping gambling because I need to do it. I‚Äôve come into recovery not knowing who or what I am or should have been. I‚Äôve been gambling since I was 18 years old, dabbling before that as well, and I never ‚Äúgrew‚Äù into the adult I was supposed to be or could have been. So I really have to start from the beginning with a blank canvas, which I honestly feel has massive potential for me, and get to write my own story of how my life goes from here on out, but I can‚Äôt do that simply by abstaining from gambling.

*‚ÄúWe can't just hope that something will happen. We must put in the work.*

*If we simply wait for our life to improve without putting in the necessary work then we aren't going anywhere.‚Äù*

B is for Blog - I read a fellow Problem Gambler Support Group members blog not long after I joined and it was all about his gambling journey. I thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good idea, I‚Äôm going to steal that‚Äù and set up my own website. It didn‚Äôt quite go like what but I thought there would be a benefit from writing my story out, for me at the very least. Turns out people liked it and said it was good and well written and they got something from it. So I wrote more and I kept getting the same feedback then decided to share my step work and tackle other topics to do with my recovery. I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm still unsure if my writing is any good, but people like it and tell me it is, so I‚Äôll just accept that and be very happy with the compliments and keep on writing. I get so much from writing my blogs, it allows me to formulate my thoughts so much better than I do when I am speaking, cause i‚Äôm Irish and I use fuck like a comma when talking, less so when writing. I also find it allows me to dig down really deep when reflecting back in my gambling past or thinking about any topic to be honest. I have found out so much about myself from my writing that it‚Äôs been a huge benefit to my recovery. It‚Äôs also amazing when someone tells me that they could relate to something I‚Äôve written or that something in my blog has helped them with their recovery. That sort of feedback is priceless for me and I‚Äôm just happy I have an opportunity to give back because at the end of the day you have to give it away to keep it.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm usually terrified people will hate my writing.*

*My only saving grace is how I direct that fear. I use it to motivate me to find better ideas and share more useful examples rather than allowing it to prevent me from sharing at all.*

*Fear is the gas pedal, not the brake.‚Äù James Clear*

C is for Choice - ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt responsible for your first thought but you are responsible for your first action‚Äù. That is one of my favourite quotes and probably one of the first things I will tell a newcomer or someone who is struggling with urges (people are probably bored of it by now but sometimes boring is good). I am a firm believer that if I want to gamble I can, yes I have blocks in place, but if I really want to do it I can choose to do it. At the same time, I also have the choice not to gamble and that is what I choose to do. Now, I understand that people suffer from urges and these can get to a point where it feels like there is no choice so they gamble. For me, it‚Äôs all about knowing what to do in those situations and what I have learned it recovery. I know if I am struggling to reach out and talk to someone (more on that later I am sure) as that is the most important tool for me. We also have the choice to break the triangle that compulsive gamblers require to gamble, money, time and opportunity. Anyone can choose to break that triangle if they want to. It all comes back to the initial quote for me though, I am responsible for my first action, it‚Äôs all about making the right choice.

*‚ÄúThe 3 C's in life: Choice, Chance, Change. You must make the Choice, to take the Chance, if you want anything in life to Change.‚Äù*

D is for Desire - The only membership requirement for Gamblers Anonymous is a desire to stop gambling. April 2nd 2019 is the first time I have truly had that desire. Up until that point the only desire I had was to hide my secret life from those closest to me and to be able to gamble as much and as long as I wanted. The definition of desire is ‚Äúa strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen‚Äù. I feel like where I am now in recovery, I have no desire to gamble which has given me an opportunity to focus on my recovery.

*Gala -¬† ‚ÄúFreed from desire, mind and senses purified‚Äù.*

E is for Excitement - That excitement or buzz that I used to get from gambling was something else and I‚Äôll be honest, I haven‚Äôt found anything that can match it on a consistent level since entering recovery. Sometimes meetings will come close, I will leave one buzzing after what I have just heard or shared, but in general, for me, recovery as a whole is a lot more relaxed. This is perfectly fine as I feel that I have accepted that I no longer need the buzz or excitement in my life all the time and that I can lead a perfectly enjoyable and fulfilling life without those high highs, because, as I know too well from experience, eventually the highs run out and they are followed by low lows.

*‚ÄúTake a break and chill out. We are always on the go, doing this or that. Sometimes we just need to sit back and relax or else the world will simply pass us by.‚Äù*

F is for Family &amp; Friends - I‚Äôll be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt be in the position I am in today if it wasn‚Äôt for my family standing by me. I fully expected to be kicked out by my partner when I told her and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see my two kids everyday. I was terrified, so I am aware of how big a step it is to tell your loved ones, but it was a step I had to take. I would rather have been a part time Dad in recovery than a ‚Äúfull time‚Äù Dad in active addiction. Plus, over the last few months I have been talking to more partners of gambling addicts and I really appreciate learning how they feel and are affected by compulsive gambling. The money isn‚Äôt the main issue, it‚Äôs the lies, the broken trust and the fact we put them in a position of enablers. I know I manipulated those closest to me to get what I wanted and I didn‚Äôt once care how they would feel about it. They are also affected and some may need support and for me hearing their experiences are a vital cog in my recovery wheel. I also wouldn‚Äôt be where I am without the understanding and support of my friends. I owed a lot of my friends money which I lied to get and I broke their trust, but they all stood by me and told me how proud they were of me for admitting I had a gambling problem. That support, along with the support of my family gave me a strong foothold when I entered recovery. The best thing I can do to repay my family and friends is to remain in recovery and work towards becoming a better person each day.

*‚ÄúLiving a double life of addiction can be exhausting. Pretending everything is okay to our family and friends when we know it isn't. Once we surrender to our addiction we open up the possibility of Recovery.‚Äù*

G is for GamCare - This is only been a place I have been fully utilising over the last few months because before then, I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt get it. I would go onto chat regularly but usually just sit there and read what other people were saying, I rarely got involved. I feel like part of it was my ego, I didn‚Äôt understand how people could just use a chat and recover. Then I started to learn that there is not a one size fits all recovery program and around November 2019 I started to get more involved. I not only used the chat room but started to post on the forum. I had a place where I could talk to other compulsive gamblers and not only help myself but help them by passing on the message. I have met some wonderful people via GamCare and some I have a great connection with, one which I hope to maintain. It was simply a case of me getting out of GamCare what I put in at the start, which wasn‚Äôt much. Now I absolutely love the place and totally see what a great tool it is for people looking for support with their recovery.

*‚ÄúIf all we do is take and never give, we will surely be weighed down by our loot.*¬†

*Recovery is as much about giving as it is receiving. We must give it away to keep it.‚Äù*

H is for Honesty - One of the mantras I constantly say to newcomers is that you need three things for a chance at a successful recovery, HOW; Honesty, Open Mindedness and Willingness. For me being honest with those closest to me was a vital first step and it lifted a huge weight of my shoulders. Then each day in recovery I have been trying to be as honest as I possibly can. It‚Äôs so much easier if you tell the truth because you only have to tell it once. Looking back to when I was gambling it was crazy the amount of lies and bullshit I was telling people, by the end I wasn‚Äôt sure what was true and what was a lie. It‚Äôs not like that today though, I can look myself in the mirror and know that I am an honest person. I feel like I am honest in my meetings and through my writing. I share things that I probably do not need to share but it helps me not only get my thoughts out but at some point someone else may hear or read it and realise they aren‚Äôt alone.

*French Proverb: ‚ÄúThere is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience.‚Äù*

I is for Intention - The subject of intent was briefly discussed at one of my Skype meetings and I feel quite strongly about this. I fully accept responsibility for my actions when gambling because when I break it all down, I was the person who chose to gamble in the first place. Each time I gambled it was my choice. The best example I have is if I went to a bar and had 5 or 6 pints and got in my car to drive home but on the way crash and kill 4 people. My intention was just to drive home, I didn‚Äôt intend to cause pain and suffering but I knew the risks when I got in the car. For me it‚Äôs the same as gambling. I may not have intended to cause pain and suffering to my kids and partner and those closest to me, but I did. These were consequences of my actions. I may not even have been fully aware of the pain I was causing or didn‚Äôt want to be aware, either way the intent was in my initial action which was gambling. Were there other outside forces at work, such as advertising and offers encouraging me to keep gambling? Yes there were but again I do not want to waste my energy blaming the industry for what has happened to me. The responsibility of what I have done lands firmly at my feet. Does that mean the industry should continue to get away with what they do? Absolutely not. Are people groomed by the industry and bled dry of all their money? 100% and it is a disgrace. There needs to be accountability of the gambling industry but for me personally, with what I went through when gambling and for my own recovery, the focus of responsibility needs to be on me and me alone. I‚Äôve been in recovery for over ten months now and the person who has changed is me, not the gambling industry. That‚Äôs what I focus on because it‚Äôs the one thing I can control and that I can really change to make a difference.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not intentions that matter. It‚Äôs actions.*¬†

*We are what we do and say, not what we intend to.‚Äù*

J is for Jeff - If I said I owe this man a lot it would be an understatement as he was instrumental in helping me from when I got into recovery. Jeff is the man behind the Problem Gambling Support Group and I had messaged him on Wednesday 3rd April 2019 asking to join the group as I had seen a post on Reddit about it. This wasn‚Äôt my first time speaking to Jeff though, that was November 2018 when I had been on Reddit under a different name and was trying to stop casino gambling online but wanted to continue sports betting...yea, didn‚Äôt work out well. Jeff contacted me around that time and we messaged back and forth one afternoon, with Jeff telling me the benefits of recovery and me trying to tell him how I could still gamble responsibly. Bottom line, I wasn‚Äôt ready for recovery then but when I was Jeff could not have been more welcoming. Jeff took me under his wing and spoke to me often in the early days and I asked him to be my Sponsor. He has helped me work the steps and has been a part of my recovery journey the whole time. I feel like I have someone who I can reach out to at any time and he‚Äôll be there for me. It‚Äôs hard to really do justice for the impact Jeff has made on my recovery, but I honestly believe things would be a lot different if it wasn‚Äôt for his support and guidance. Sponsorship has been so important to me and up until recently I didn‚Äôt believe I had what it takes to be one but I have been given an opportunity to be a Sponsor now and I am loving it. If I can be half the Sponsor that Jeff has been to me I know I‚Äôll be a success.

*‚ÄúFellowship is so important to Recovery*¬†

*What we can't do on our own, we can do together. From Friendship to Sponsorship to Relationships we need people in our life to help us with our Recovery.‚Äù*

K is for Kids - My kids are my life but I have not hidden the fact that I had gambling above them when I was practicing my addiction. I don‚Äôt say that lightly as it really does upset me to think about it but that is how it was. I gambled without a single thought about them and I needed gambling in my life more than I thought I needed them. Now, my kids were always looked after, mainly by my partner, but I also spent time with them, only they had me there in body but my mind was escaping into the world of online gambling. Since entering recovery I have realised how much I actually love my kids (even though they can be wee bastards at times) and they are my Higher Power. When I am struggling with a choice to make I think how my actions will impact my kids. I‚Äôve spent so much more quality time with them and I love spending that time together. It‚Äôs easy to sit here now and say that I have made it up to my kids or that they were too young to understand, but when they have experienced their Dad shouting at them for no reason because I was losing bets or they were interrupting my gambling that leaves emotional scars for them. I‚Äôll never be able to remove those scars, all I can do is continue on my recovery journey and become someone they are proud to say is their Dad.

*‚ÄúIf we hold onto the past it is bound to weigh us down. The past made us the people we are today but holding onto shame and guilt will inevitably lead us back down the rabbit hole. Don't forget the past, but don't let it prevent you from living for today.‚Äù*

L is for Life - There‚Äôs so many different ways I could take this but where I will go first is that I truly believe that I will be a compulsive gambler for the rest of my life. Now, that sounds quite scary, I‚Äôll be going to meetings for life, I‚Äôll be unable to gamble for the rest of my life, I‚Äôll potentially have an element of fear for the rest of my life. The good news is I just have to worry about arresting the addiction a day at a time, it‚Äôs a lifelong journey with a daily program is how I look at it. I also want to briefly mention how I got a life back, not my life but a life. That‚Äôs because I have grown into an adult with my addiction, I have met my partner with my addiction and I have had kids with my addiction. I have no idea what my life is supposed to look like without gambling in it or what it should have looked like as I grew into an adult. So I have been given a clean slate to make a new life for myself, to become the person that I want to be. That is exciting and of course a little scary but it is an opportunity I am grateful to receive.

*‚ÄúEntering Recovery represents the start of a new Life*¬†

*A life where we don't have to worry about how to get the next one or if we remember the mess we got ourselves into last night. Recovery is the start of a good life.‚Äù*

M is for Meetings - Many meetings make it easy was a saying I heard at my G.A meetings and I have to say I agree with it. I do one in person G.A. meeting a week (#MondayNightCrew4Life) and I also do three Skype meetings a week with my Problem Gambling Support Group which involves gamblers from all around the world. Both are different which I like but I still get so much from both groups. It helps the people in both are brilliant and I feel I have gotten really lucky in that regard. Looking back to my first G.A. meeting, I assumed I would be sat with a bunch of old men trying to convert me to religion or else desperate for a bet and I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be for me, but up until that point the decisions I had made weren‚Äôt exactly the best so I thought fuck it, what‚Äôs the worst that can happen, I waste a couple of hours. My first meeting was amazing, I left absolutely buzzing. I found a group of people who could relate to me and who understood what I was going through, but more than that, they had actually been in my shoes and knew how to walk this journey. So I said to myself I‚Äôm going to share in meetings but the most important thing for me was to actually listen and take on board what was said. It was the same for my Skype meetings, although a different format, it was full of people who once were in my position. Many meetings not only make it easy in my opinion, but they make recovery.

*‚ÄúWe take solace in the rooms of Recovery*¬†

*There is comfort and love in this place. We feel safe.*

*Just For Today I am grateful for all the rooms of recovery which house those in need.‚Äù*

N is for Neglect - Where do I even begin with this one. I neglected everything in my life when I was gambling, my health from hardly eating and hardly sleeping to my job where I didn‚Äôt do any work to my friendships that I allowed to drift away because I didn‚Äôt put any effort into them as they got in the way of my gambling to relationships which I allowed to turn to shit right before my eyes. I think the relationships with those closest to me is what hurts the most and it‚Äôs because of the hurt I have caused them. They‚Äôll have to live with those scars for the rest of their life. It‚Äôs all good me being in recovery and wanting to become a better person, but I wasn‚Äôt the only one being harmed for 14 years, those closest to me were also harmed and I don‚Äôt even know how much hurt I inflicted. I‚Äôll probably never know. My kids are what kills me when I look back, as they had to deal with me shouting at them for no reason because I was having a shit time. I was taking the consequences of my choices and my actions out on them and I wasn‚Äôt a nice person to be around. Although I was never violent I also know that words hurt and the fact is I wasn‚Äôt the sort of Dad I wanted to be, but more importantly, that they deserved to have.

*‚ÄúA little neglect may breed great mischief.‚Äù Benjamin Franklin*

O is for Open Mindedness - The second part of ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù and something that was alien to me coming into recovery. To me being open minded meant listening to other people's opinions, which if I didn‚Äôt already know and agreed with, meant I thought they were shit. There was no winning me round with facts, I‚Äôd just try to convince you that I was right and my way was the best way. Well, once I got into meetings I sat on my chair (or virtual chair for Skype) and closed my mouth and opened my ears. The best story I can relate to this in my recovery is from my G.A. meetings. There was one member the first few times I listened to him share I thought ‚Äúfuck me he goes on a bit and I don‚Äôt get it‚Äù then a few weeks later he shared a story and I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs me, that guy is me and if I go back out there I‚Äôll be living his life story‚Äù. From that point, I‚Äôve listened to everything he says and he‚Äôs one of my favourite speakers but it also taught me to listen to each person because you never know what they will say that just hits you. Another part of open mindedness for me is listening to what everyone suggests to me and trying it because if it‚Äôs worked for them it might work for me. Not everything has worked for me but I‚Äôve yet to get a suggestion that harmed me or my recovery in any way.

*‚ÄúOur best thinking got us here... We must remain open-minded to new ideas in Recovery. They may not all work for us, but we should at least be willing to hear what they are about.‚Äù*

P is for Present - Not Xmas presents but present as in today. I really struggle to recognise the progress I have made in my recovery so this feels like a good way to take this word, comparing me today vs me when I came into recovery. Honesty is a big one which I have obviously covered earlier but I do find myself being much more honest than I was. Do I always get it right? Not at all, either withholding thoughts or feelings or only telling part of a story has got me into bother on occasion but I am trying to be as honest as I can. I‚Äôve spent most of my life lying about everything so it‚Äôs hard to be so honest, but if you tell the truth you only have to tell it once. How I feel about other people has also changed massively as I used to fucking hate the world. I hated everyone in it and assumed they were going out of their way to make my life miserable. Turns out the only person going out of their way to do that was me. Now I really, genuinely care for other people, in recovery, outside of recovery, I have empathy, I‚Äôm willing to reach out and let people know they aren‚Äôt alone. My mental health has also definitely improved and although I struggle with low self-esteem, I am generally in a good place whereas when I came into recovery I was broken. Relationships with those closest to me are something that have improved but there is still a lot of work to do in one of them. That‚Äôs something that hopefully will continue to improve over time. I‚Äôll finish with this, I have a voice now, a voice that I can use for myself but also for good. When I came into recovery I was used to just telling people what I thought they wanted to hear as I was trying to hide my secret life, now I can just be me and feel comfortable using my voice.

*‚ÄúThe past is a place of reference, not a place of residence.‚Äù*

Q is for Quitting - Quitting is something that has come so easy to me in other aspects of my life, quitting hockey, friends, hobbies whatever it is, but I couldn‚Äôt quit when I was gambling. I would always tell myself if I got ahead I‚Äôd quit and withdraw but rarely did I manage it, and if I did it was deposited straight back into the bookies once it hit my account. After a while there was no quitting when I was ahead because I was so far behind I was never going to be able to get ahead. I even tried quitting the casino side of things after it became a problem (I only started playing the casino side the last 18 months of my active addiction) to focus on sports betting because in my head I wasn‚Äôt addicted to sports. That was a lie of course, but I still went back to the casino side of things when I had money because I just could not quit that buzz and excitement.

*‚ÄúI honestly thought I would use until I died. The thought of quitting gambling wasn't plausible, impossible actually.*¬†

*Just For Today I will believe in the impossible because at one time this current existence was impossible.‚Äù*

R is for Recovery - I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I have thrown myself head first into my recovery and fully embraced it. I get so much out of it and I put a lot of work into it. This is what my recovery looks like, and while all of it isn‚Äôt for everyone, I feel it shows the difference between abstinence and recovery. I attend one in person G.A. meeting a week, three Skype meetings with my Problem Gambling Support Group, I have a Sponsor, I Sponsor someone, I work the Steps, I write my blog and post it on the Reddit Problem Gambling Sub and GamCare forum, I use the GamCare chat rooms twice a day most days, I reach out and offer help and support if I can, I listen to podcasts about addiction, I have been on two podcasts sharing my story, I do my own research on addiction and I am going to start and learn about SMART Recovery. Think that‚Äôs it all, and while it looks like a lot, it‚Äôs nothing compared to the time I spent gambling and it all fits around my life. I feel like recovery is the thing that has been missing from my life, that place where I am accepted for being me, a place where I can make a difference. Recovery is so important to me and my life and without it there is no way I would have stopped gambling.

*‚ÄúRecovery is a transformation of self. From the ashes of defeat in the battle of Addiction to a renewed sense of purpose in the triumph of Recovery. We strive to become better and better with each passing day.‚Äù*

S is for Springsteen - I love Bruce Springsteen and listening to his music really resonates with me and can help me think and process my emotions and thoughts. Music really does have that sort of power and it has been a vital tool during my recovery. I can get lost in music, almost like an escape, but for me it‚Äôs a healthy escape. My personality needs some alone time to be able to recharge and that‚Äôs when I turn to music. I find lyrics jumping out at me and meaning different things at various stages of my recovery. A lyric will transport me back to a time or place and make me remember, good or bad, what had happened. Music can also just help me go from feeling down to feeling happy and realise that things aren‚Äôt as bad as I thought there were.

*‚ÄúBruce Springsteen is the direct line to all that is true in this shitty world‚Äù.*

T is for Talking - This was something I have come to find is one of my most useful tools I have developed and used in recovery. In the past I would never have opened up and spoken about my feelings but now I am in recovery I feel more confident to talk to at least one person about what is going on in my head. I‚Äôve found talking has been an amazing way for me to solve problems that have been bothering me and eating away at me. Even just to vent is such a powerful tool, it can make me realise that I am making a big deal out of something that really isn‚Äôt. It also allows me to ask for advice and to get used to the fact that I do not possess all the answers. It was about swallowing my pride and realises that the main benefit of a support network is to rely on it when you need it. Sometimes I have asked questions that have made me feel stupid, but I have never been judged. Talking is one of the most important tools I have and it is something I always say to anyone I talk to in recovery, if you are ever struggling then reach out to me or to someone else, even if it‚Äôs just to say what is on your mind.

*‚ÄúAsking for help is hard. It certainly didn't come naturally to me and can still be a struggle.*

*Just For Today I will ask for help when I need it.‚Äù*

U is for Understood - Recovery is the first place I have really felt that people have understood me and what I have put myself through with my gambling addiction. ‚ÄúPut myself through‚Äù sounds like I am a victim, they have understood what I did when gambling. The longer I have been in recovery the more I feel people understand this new me that I have become, even more so than those in my life outside of recovery because they see me ‚Äúin action‚Äù so to speak, in meetings, through my writing, helping others etc. There is something about going into a meeting and knowing, that no matter what you say or feel, you can feel safe sharing it and will not be judged.

*‚ÄúI am not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes.. but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am.‚Äù*

V is for Vicious - The vicious cycle that I was in when gambling broke me mentally, it was insanity when I look back on it. I would get paid and the first thing I would do is stay up until my pay hit my bank account around 1am and deposit and gamble. I would then pay back any money I had borrowed from friends or family and pay bounced direct debits from the previous month. I would then gamble more than I intended, have to bounce more direct debits, had to borrow more money from friends and family by lying to them. My phone bill was around ¬£275 a month because of my insanity on top of all this. I was borrowing more money from people and from companies (although luckily I had wrecked my credit rating early on in my gambling career or it could have been far worse) and it was just getting worse and worse each month. One of my friends asked me before, ‚Äúhow the fuck did you sleep at night?‚Äù and looking back I have no idea.

*‚ÄúWe are grateful to be in Recovery today. To think the pain of active addiction is in the rear view mirror, but we must remain vigilant. If we let up in our program for too long our addiction will surely catch up to us.*¬†

*Just For Today I will commit myself to my program.‚Äù*

W is for Willingness - The final part of ‚ÄúHOW‚Äù and without it, for me, recovery would have been impossible. I threw myself head first into my recovery and was open to whatever people suggested to me and was willing to try. Someone once told me I was very teachable when it came to recovery and I think that proves the willingness I had. I knew if I was going to come out about my gambling, if I was going to admit I had a problem and needed help, I would lose the one thing I loved at that point and that was gambling. If I was going to lose gambling I was going to make sure it was worth it. Quickly in recovery I realised that my kids were the most important thing to me and that if I went back to gambling I would lose them. I am not willing for that to happen. I want to become a better person, I want to become a better Dad and I want to improve myself in all possible aspects. Recovery has given me a new lease of life and a willingness to succeed. I have even started a Diploma in Counselling Skills - Level 2 online which is something I would never have done if I was still gambling.

*‚ÄúAt some point there is no excuse, either you want to do everything it takes to make it happen, or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù*

X is for X Roads - Or crossroads, yeah I cheated a little, big deal. I feel like I have had two massive crossroads in my life regarding my gambling and recovery. The first is obviously when I decided that I was going to come clean to my partner. I have written before about the weekend prior to entering recovery and that was the pivotal moment. Without going into the details I‚Äôll just say it was an up and down roller coaster of emotions and money that ended up with me at zero. It was at that point something in my head clicked and realised I was never going to be able to win my way out of this mess, it was only going to get worse. The question was did I want to own up and face the consequences or did I want to keep digging? For me the consequences of telling my partner was her kicking me out and me not being able to see my kids every day, that scared me to death. I can still remember the day I told my partner vividly. She had gone to the gym with her friend and I was pacing around the living room with a notebook in my hand. Earlier that day a friend of mine at work realised I wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äúusual‚Äù self and asked if I wanted to go for a drink at lunch. So I did and told him what was going on. He was great and listened and said he reckons I should tell my partner and get the help I needed. So I wrote out all my debts, my budget going forward and my closest G.A. meeting, just in case I would forget anything when I was telling her. So her friend's car pulls up after the gym and she comes in and sits down. At this point I am still 50/50 in my head if I am going to tell her or not and my head is spinning. Then she starts telling me about the gym and how she got on and I was thinking to myself, ‚ÄúWHO THE F\*\*K CARES ABOUT THE F\*\*KING GYM! I‚ÄôM TRYING TO DECIDE IF I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT MY GAMBLING ADDICTION!‚Äù My heart is beating so fast at this point like it‚Äôs going to jump out of my chest and I am panicking. So she finally stops talking and I just spit it out that I have a gambling problem and need help. I was crying, not for sympathy but because of the relief of finally admitting it, not only to her, but to myself, for the first time. I handed her the notebook and I was just waiting for her to throw me out but she didn‚Äôt, she stood by me. Got me to call round my parents and tell them and that‚Äôs when I officially entered recovery. The other crossroad was fairly recently in recovery, and I would say it wasn‚Äôt long after I was ten months gamble free. I basically had a real crisis of confidence, my low self-esteem came to the fore and I was debating if this new me was the real me or was I actually just a fraud. I think this came from a perfect storm of things. I always struggled with low self-esteem but I hadn‚Äôt really addressed it in recovery and I did my therapy reading at my Skype group and the feedback I got was overwhelmingly positive. People were saying really good things about me and I don‚Äôt think I was expecting it. Then around the same time I also had some other people telling me how much I had helped them, how good my writing was and how good a person I was and I think I just panicked. That voice inside my head telling me I wasn‚Äôt good enough was getting louder and louder and I was afraid that I was a fraud. I was afraid my recovery was a lie. I reached out and talked to people close to me and after several pretty intense hours I realised that it was down to me, I had to believe in myself. I had to take that leap of faith. I was also told to ‚Äúremember that someone believes in you...me‚Äù, and that will stick with me forever. So, in my head I was standing on the top of a cliff and I just had to take a leap of faith and embrace this person I had become, waiting for me on the cliff top was the old me, my old behaviours and I didn‚Äôt want any part of that. So that‚Äôs what I did, I took that leap of faith and believed in myself.

*‚ÄúFeeling our Emotions again after we stop using can be very difficult. After suppressing what we felt for so long it is completely foreign to feel so much. Learning to process these feeling is important to maintain our Recovery‚Äù*

Y is for You Know Who You Are - If I tried to name everyone who has had an impact on my recovery I would easily miss people out, so instead I am going to list what people have done for me or how they have made me feel and as the name suggests, you know who you are. You are the person who made me feel welcome, who made me smile, who made me laugh when I thought it was impossible, who stood by me, who looked after my finances, who gave me time to pay money back, who helped me up when I was down, who celebrated the good times with me, who talked to me when I needed someone, who listened to me when I needed to vent, who called me out on my bullshit, who gave me opportunities to improve myself, who made me believe in myself, who told me I was good enough, who told me I deserve this, who told me they were proud of me, who appreciated my help, who asked me for advice, who was honest with me, who made me see clearly, who inspires me by their commitment to life, who inspires me by their commitment to recovery, who read my blogs, who wanted me to succeed and who told me I could achieve my dreams.

*‚ÄúTime goes by so fast, people go in and out of your life. Don't miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you.‚Äù*

Z is for Zombification - Is an instance or process of turning into a zombie. The process of zombification involves poisoning an individual with toxin from a puffer fish. So, I guess gambling is the puffer fish in this case because I could literally feel myself dying inside as I gambled at times. Time just slipped away while I said I would gamble for an hour, I was transfixed by the world of online gambling, it sucked me in and slowly sucked the life out of me. I would sit until the wee hours of the morning with no idea what was going on around me. I‚Äôd barely eat when gambling, I didn‚Äôt need to, there was no feeling of hunger. The longer I gambled the more numb I became to my emotions until the point I literally could feel emotion. I didn‚Äôt get angry or sad or happy, I was just meh. I went to my Granda‚Äôs funeral in January 2019 and couldn‚Äôt understand why people were upset. I felt nothing. Gambling had turned me into a zombie. Recovery is the process of de-zombification.

*‚ÄúAt your very core, you are energy.*

*Stop killing it by killing yourself.*

*By slowly poisoning yourself.*

*By destroying your mind.*

*By chasing negativity.*

*Nurture your energy.*

*Let it grow &amp; thrive.‚Äù*

That was a long one but well worth the effort. I hope there‚Äôs something relatable there for anyone who reads it. I got a lot out of hitting on different topics in a shorter form and some stuff may not have made it into a ‚Äúregular‚Äù blog.

292,1,Day 1Nothing too elaborate to post here. Have been gambling for years chasing those big wins and as a result have been wasting countless thousands of dollars. I have a good job and make good money and yet can‚Äôt seem to stop gambling it all away. Burnt through my life savings and put myself into debt chasing that ‚Äúlife changing win‚Äù but in reality it‚Äôs gambling that changed my life for the worse. Time to cut it off before it ruins me.
293,1,Day 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£
294,1,DAY 1This day sucks üò£. I just know I really need to stop gambling. I really hope.
295,1,Day 5Ô∏è‚É£
296,1,"Day 6Hope everyone here has a gamble free weekend. 

Remember, you can either have very bad luck and lose all your money quickly OR have some good luck and lose all your money less quickly.  

You are not a responsible gambler so know that when you get into your car afterwards, I‚Äôm 99.99 percent sure you will not have good thoughts.  Maybe a tear in the eye, maybe hitting the steering wheel.

Just don‚Äôt do it."
297,1,"My method to stop chasing my lossesOk so everyone on this sub has losses, mine is in the thousands but there are people here in the hundreds of thousands maybe even millions (maybe, I hope not).

Anyway, recently the way I‚Äôve stopped myself from gambling has been all in my mind, nothing physical.

So most of us would probably stop gambling if all our losses were given to us, let‚Äôs say I lose ¬£500, if someone gave me that ¬£500 again i wouldn‚Äôt want to gamble again, probably, I hope.

The point is, we‚Äôre sad about our losses.

What I‚Äôve been doing is, thinking about stuff that people spend money on that I don‚Äôt, and it helps me calm down and not want to chase my losses.

For example, I don‚Äôt go clubbing and when I do I rarely buy drinks because I don‚Äôt like alcohol, more of a Weed and LSD Guy (would much rather spend my money on non addictive drugs than gambling).

So I think of the people who go and spend money on drinks, like my friend who pissed away ¬£1000 on closing down a bar for the night, or my other friend who spent ¬£400 buying drinks for everyone.

I like gambling, I don‚Äôt like losing money, I may have pissed away ¬£1000 on blackjack, but I didn‚Äôt piss away ¬£1000 on drinks, because I like blackjack more than I like drinks.

This makes gambling seem like a very expensive luxury rather than an addictive way to make (lose) money.

And it should be treated as such, a very expansive luxury.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm making sense because I‚Äôm high but the point is, maybe you lost ¬£10,000 on gambling but you didn‚Äôt spend ¬£10,000 buying heroin or invest ¬£10,000 and lost it.

Now stop chasing your losses and be glad you didn‚Äôt spend it somewhere else.

(I honestly want someone to get my point and rewrite it in the comments and make it more sense, I hope I‚Äôm making some sense. Genuinely, everyone on this sub, I love you all, you‚Äôre all so supportive and all I‚Äôm trying to do with this post is support you with this idea I had)"

300,1,Day 5 üôèüèªCan‚Äôt go back to the dark side
301,1,"Day 112I was extremely close from gambling yesterday. I managed to stave off the impulse as I remembered a saying that it takes generally 10 minutes for someone to think clearly - I went for a walk and thought through most of the possibilities that I'm so familiar with. It played like a video in my head.

I was at work when this happened. By the time I got back to the desk, my impulse to gamble was gone. Instead, I paid off debts and bills that I needed to pay off.

It's always the toughest when there's a little bit of spare cash in the bank."
302,1,Day 146
303,1,"Relapse - please helpI am 22, I‚Äôve relapsed again today and lost $900. I would say I‚Äôve lost a total of around $15,000. It is almost a weird relief hitting rock bottom as I can rebuild and start fresh. Any words of advice out there? I start full time work in March at a graduate position I got as I‚Äôve just finished university with a commerce degree. 

Thanks again everyone!"
304,1,"Day 0. Enough is enough.Back to day 0. I thought let me try another $300 and see if J can work it up to my magical 25,000. Got up to $600 and then lost it all.

I honestly do not enjoy gambling at all. Its the losses I am chasing. Better stop now and just swallow my pride losing 25,000. Felt a little suicidal today... any suggestions to get me to a happier place right now?"
305,1,100 Days Yay!! üéâüéâüéâ
306,1,Day 180
307,1,First week downTry to look at your bank account as little as possible. Set up automatic payments for credit cards and such so you can distance yourself from seeing what you have to gamble with. Seeing I had money to spend has been the only trigger.
308,1,"Dad's been gamblingToday, my dad (61) broke the news to my family (mom, older sister, me) that he had an online gambling problem. He has been in addiction counseling for 8 months.   


This came to a complete and total shock. None of us had an idea and I was completely surprised. I am wracking my brain and I saw absolutely no signals that something was going on. 

I am proud of him for seeking help before he was caught and for telling us. I know it wasn't easy for him but he certainly jeopardized his and my mother's retirement as he is very deep in debt .  

This is all very overwhelming to me. Does anyone have any resources for families of gamblers? I feel scared for my mom's financial future. I feel guilty that my dad was going through this alone for so long. I feel sad because it hurts. I feel betrayed. I look back over the past few years and our memories together feel tainted. I have a lot of questions for him, for God, for anyone who will listen.

I have reached out to in person professional support but I can't be seen until next Thursday. 

Hoping someone out there who is either recovering or supporting someone who is recovering  that can help me find some resources to help me process all this until I can see a family counselor next week. 

Any advice, support, resources, thoughts, etc would be helpful in this time of grieving."
309,1,"Day 5Went to my Thursday GA meeting today.  It‚Äôs a little weird to see the ‚Äúnew guys‚Äù now approaching a year clean time while I‚Äôm struggling.  It used to be me that gave them that perfect advice to keep them out of the casino.  Now the tables have turned. 

Just trying to remember, one day at a time while trying to do the next right thing.

For those just starting on this road to recovery, welcome.   The first few days are extremely difficult but the support of the wonderful folks here can be a huge help.   

We‚Äôre all in this together.  Our stories may differ, our gambling may differ, but one thing remains for all of us....we all just want to be better people.  Let‚Äôs do this."
319,1,"There's no place for self controlI keep telling myself that I can control my addiction and I can walk out anything when I have somewhat of a winning. And it always proves to be a lie... 

I unbanned myself and lost 500 then won 2000 and wow, i should quit again right? well I lost that 2000 the same day and 500 more the next day.  So today I had 0 cash left, but my mom gave me 20 euros, stupid me decided to test luck again, before going to casino I thought if i turn this 20 into 50 im happy and walk out. well i turned it into 80 and then i proceeded to lose everything. Fuck...... To be honest I feel so shitty its unimaginable im on the verge of collapsing, im proud of all of you for keeping it together and moving forward, but i just feel like such a degenarate piece of shit you dont believe. Average salary in my country is 700 euro and I have fucking 25k debt at 22 years old. I dont want to live anymore, im just sitting crying and thinking about all the good stuff i could do to my parents and my sister with so much money that i have lost. I know I am talented and smart, because I make 1300-1400 a month at just 22 in eastern europe, but   my quality of work has downgraded and now i make 1100 because im so depressed i dont see a bright future for me anymore, i cant deal with this shit, the debt is crippling me and I have to lie to everyone because the last time i told about this problem to my family they started drinking heavily and stuff.. just FUCK........ thanks for reading my rant, im still in this world just because i know im not alone and you guys are experiencing similar stuff...."
320,1,"Day 0I am back to Day 0. With a really successful breaks until this recent relapse. This relapse wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, I started it with a $5k win and followed with a $5k loss, overall net zero. But its still bad that I have relapsed.

I am currently still $41k down. This relapse made me learn a lot about how I will never win at the casino. Because as long as the compulsiveness stays within me, I will never be satisfied enough to walk away with my winnings.

I am a compulsive gambler for the past 1309 days and this has resulted to a daily loss of $31.33 every single day. The highest daily tax that I have ever paid in life.

I hope to keep Reddit updated with my going clean journey."
321,1,"Two weeks!Currently I have zero interest in gambling. My gambling of choice was sports betting and as such I spent a lot of time researching and watching sports. Since stopping I‚Äôve made an effort to keep my self busy. This has included exercise, reading and taking my dogs out whenever possible. 

To everyone out there who doubt they will never be able to give up this horrible addiction stay strong. The first step for me was to admit to myself that I did have a problem. The second step was to realise and accept that I would never make back my losses through gambling. 

Stay strong everyone and believe in yourself!"
322,1,"Day sixI‚Äôm six days in. Earlier I had my first real urge and I was really entertaining the idea of depositing some money. For me, this early on, I‚Äôm not focused on committing to a lifetime free of gambling. That‚Äôs not something you need to decide six days in. I want to make progress. If that‚Äôs three months, a year or whatever. Right now I‚Äôm focused on developing a skill/mindset. If I give in this early, I wouldn‚Äôt have built much of a foundation or confidently known what worked and what didn‚Äôt. When I felt the urge, all the things I had been telling myself previously had become foggy. But I knew I had tools even if I can‚Äôt think of what those where  I decided I would wait until I could actually use them. 
Anyways, so far so good."
323,1,"6 months!Hi all

Im at around 6 months I think  and I just wanted to share this with all of you as I know when I first started off I didn't think this was possible. I don't really count days but try and go a day at a time and when you get to certain length of time it's not always at the forefront of your mind so I shift my thinking to other things I want to improve in my life like going the gym more etc which is great. 

I come back and visit this sub regularly because I think it's easy to slip up if you don't remind yourself of the state you were in before and also to look at how far you've come.

From my experience putting up barriers is one of the most important things and the other which I'm still working on is not to just act on impulses and think everything is OK now. I need to remember what it was like, how I would feel, the consequences of my actions to keep moving forward. 

Anyway I hope this helps those of you who are in the early stages or on day 1."

No real urges.  

I read in the Carr book that I gamble to escape the uncomfortable feelings gambling gave me.  And the only time I feel like a non gambler does is when I‚Äôm gambling.  

There‚Äôs some truth to this, when I‚Äôm not in action I‚Äôm thinking about the damage i did or counting down to the next payday.  Stressing over money that could have been put to better use.

I am an officer at a lodge that has them and even though they don't pay out big, since most of ours are a max of $500, yet I have to chase the thrill, the chance of pulling those tabs open and seeing that big payout but hardly hitting it even though I've spent at least twice that on a good day into that one game. I can spend 1 or 2k in a month chasing that $500 cardboard reveal and think all is right in the world, until I look at my accounts. I've always made sure bills are paid and I can live on what I have because it was just me, but recently I've found myself in a relationship with someone I love and she loves me even with my cardboard chasing dreams. I've tried to stop playing and do ok for a while but I'll hit a funk or have a bad day then fall back on that. How do you guys scratch that itch or distract yourselves from playing the game? I don't want to leave the lodge because of it since we help a lot of people and I'm one of the few officers that do anything, but I can't keep pulling one tab at a time in hopes for that big payout that will never really happen."

346,1,Sports bettors let me here your story.Hi all just curious to hear how you much you lost and stopped betting and came back from it. Trying to put that little voice in my head away telling me I was one game away from winning it all back
347,1,"Day 14Two full weeks today ... in previous times quitting i had fooled myself into thinking that once I quit, i'd have no more issues at all.  Truth is, recovering doesn't take away your issues, but it does alloq you to deal with them instead of digging deeper holes.  My relationship with my wife/kids has improved over the last 14 days.  My general state of hapiness has improved as well.  I've been hit with some big bills over the last couple weeks, such is life ... not letting it trigger me.  All gambling will do is put me further in the hole.  Still find that the hardst thing to deal with is the guilt &amp; regret, but I'm dealing with it.  I meet with my therapist twice a week and I have an accountability partner that I check in with several times a day.  Not going to GA, tried it, hated it, not my speed.  Other than that, the only other thing I can do is stay clean.  I really do firmly believe that my life will be better if I'm clean than if I'm gambling, and that's true even if I win gambling.  With gambling, at least for me, even if I win, I lose."

But who knows when that will happen when im down 150K probably. Thankfully I am not in debt but i needed that money for a house downpayment. I just cant stop thinking about the money.

I think the biggest inspiration to going to GA was the podcast.  It‚Äôs good to have that voice in my head and I put it on when I drive longer distances and sometimes past a casino or two.  

I shared in my GA meeting that I want all my time back.  That it‚Äôs hard to start over again. I miss having over a year abstinence and going back to day 3 right now just feels insurmountable.  

I guess I take solace in the saying to be patient and that time will pass."

360,1,"Trying to tie up money - Expecting a large inflow soonHey there.

I am a big fan of the After Gambling podcast. 

I've been clean from gambling since April 2016.

During that time my ex-gf and father (he is a compulsive gambler, i feel) have held my money. However, it was never really a large amount.

I've recently obtained an opportunity to make a considerable amount more income. I do not trust my father enough to hold this kind of money.

My sponsor has offered for us to have a type of account (if it is possible) where the money can be deposited but the only way to withdraw it is in person with both of us there.

I've done a lot of online research and bank phone calls with inconclusive results.

Have any of you experienced something similar? Thanks!

TLDR: Is there a bank account where two people have to be together in person for any debit/withdrawal transaction to occur?"
361,1,Day 3As another day falls so does the distance from my last bet. Mindful of the triggers (like work and relationships) and will continue to look ahead - somehow!
362,1,Day 9Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£
363,1,Day 48 ... I. Don‚Äôt. Want. It. Anymore. Period.
364,1,"Day 4 - getting enticed but I still feel painI still feel the pain of my losses! Around ¬£25k in total for the last 3 years.

I don‚Äôt have a car or nothing becusse if this addiction.

Embarrassing. Let me focus on my days and hopefully my saving helps me recoup."
365,1,"Token reminderHi all!  It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I‚Äôve come clean to my husband. He had suggested we get something matching as a reminder that we are working on this together. As a reminder that I‚Äôm in recovery. I had suggested tattoos but that got squashed. Lol!  He suggested necklaces but I said I can‚Äôt see it unless I‚Äôm looking in the mirror. So we finally decided on getting bracelets. I got him a simple thin braided leather bracelet from Michaels craft store. 2 for $7. And I got one from Pandora.  (Because it was pink)

Whether you‚Äôre in this alone, or with a partner or a friend, I think it‚Äôs a great idea to be wearing something you constantly see as a reminder of your recovery. I‚Äôm wearing mine on my left hand as I always look at my watch. It doesn‚Äôt have to be jewelry. Maybe something you see every day. I know this isn‚Äôt for everyone but wanted to share the idea in case someone thinks it will help them out."
366,1,"Days 57, 58 and 59Made it through the weekend and decided to work today even though it‚Äôs President‚Äôs Day. Tomorrow makes two months. Six more times makes a year. I still regret my last binge just as much as I did two months ago. Can you believe that I have just now made back what I had lost then? Two fucking months. It‚Äôs like a punch in the stomach every time I think about it. What a waste. Getting clean time in feels great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but in a way, makes my losses sting a little more. I guess it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not lying and rationalizing and diminishing my losses this time as an excuse to go on a chase. I‚Äôm hoping with more clean time behind me, I‚Äôll be able to celebrate my future savings more than my past losses. One day at a time!"

368,1,"Day 0I don‚Äôt know who invented fish tables but i personally hate them, also I‚Äôm back at it again after winning from the prior day. I was good for about two months, but my relapse usually happen when Im weak minded and this past week I was. I created a savings because i felt confident in myself to save, not gamble, and to just build my account after last year losing over 2k. 

This past week I went through a lot of personal issues and for a comfort I decided to gamble, after the two months. I lost the money I had, my 240 in savings and whatever I had in my checkings, Sunday i won it all back plus a few extra and i personally thought i was done. 

Today I got alone, my schedule was clear and my mind wondered, ‚Äúwhat if I could win more?‚Äù Went to three different places won a little and left, the last place I won but did not stop so I‚Äôm back at square one. 

I‚Äôm only 20, don‚Äôt know how to stop these thoughts to be honest. They come so fast and before I can think about it, I‚Äôm playing already or lost all my money. How to do stop? Where is a good place to start?"
369,1,Day 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£
370,1,"Daily Anti-Gambling PillDriving home from my most recent relapse, I began thinking about how to explain to my loved ones how I could keep failing when I claim to ""want to"" quit so bad. The idea of a ""cure gambling addiction immediately and permanently"" pill came to me as a tool to explain. 

Imagine, if you will, a pill that immediately and permanently would cure your gambling addiction BUT half the time you would die. 

Any ""normal"" person would, of course, say ""Hell no I wouldn't take a pill where 50% of people experience death as a side-effect!""

As for me, (and I would imagine many of us here) I would take that pill IN A SECOND.

Then I thought to myself what if my odds were even worse? What if I was going to die 60% of the time? What about 80% of the time?

That ended up being where I personally could confidently draw my personal limit; I am willing to take a 1-in-5 chance at ""curing"" my addiction where the other 4-in-5 times I would die.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't used the thought experiment as a way to explain/reveal my recent relapse to my family but it sent me down a different path. I realized that while I have absolutely no means to create such a cure, I have EVERYTHING I NEED to create a similar pill that could help the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

I've created a morning routine of taking my ""GambleAway Today"" daily muilti-vitamin. This is a mental medication in which you take some time to reflect on how the false cognitions we create around gambling have destroyed me in the past. I then move on to thoughts of what my future could look like if I never gambled again. Finally, I set my intentions that I won't gamble TODAY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once my pill is ""taken"" I have a great sense of relief because I don't have to battle that day anymore; I already took my daily vaccine and ensured I won't gamble. I can casually observe ""cravings"" with the confidence that my pill will protect me from them (only for today). 

&amp;#x200B;

It's birth control for gamblers; prevents the spawning of demonic debt children.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no chance to quit gambling forever, but if I take my pill I am GUARANTEED to be safe for today.

Take you pill people. 

Everyday."
371,1,"Day 1Ô∏è‚É£Well here I am. I have gone through all the ups and downs for years. 24 years old and my parents sent me to a gambling counselor in college because I didn‚Äôt have money to pay the bookie. I remember how physically sick I felt and all the sleepless nights. Take a couple weeks, maybe month or two off- right back it. I have probably been through that cycle 9 or 10 times. My family enjoys gambling so it comes up in conversation frequently (they are not problem gamblers, just casual) and I feel like I can‚Äôt go two hours without seeing some reference to gambling. Podcasts, billboards, sports radio.... it‚Äôs everywhere. 

Right now I am fully 100% committing to have made my last bet tonight. I have 6/7 K in credit card debts built up through the years and I know I can knock this out in a couple months, but this cycle must end. I have a great family, good job, a girlfriend for a couple years who I love, but this gambling demon trapped inside me. I swear I must spend 14 of my 16 waken hours thinking about gambling!

Sorry for rambling on as it kind of feels like I‚Äôm talking to nobody, but just typing it feels like a clean start (although I‚Äôve tried and said that 375 times.) I know there is a community out there and we must continue to support each other as I see so much of you already do. I just submitted my PA igaming self exclusion and am looking forward to starting the ‚Äúlife after gambling‚Äù podcast tomorrow!!!

375,1,"Win/loss statement was eye opening Day 11Day 11 after spiraling since September of last year. I knew the numbers were bad, but my win/loss statement for last year was staggering. Realizing that every year I have gambled that I have ALWAYS shown a loss of a significant amount (usually over $10,000). 

Need to remind myself of this if I ever go back to, just one big win will get me back. It‚Äôs not true at all. Glad that I took the steps to ban myself and really took away the immediate option to gamble. Driving Uber on top of my day job and working harder than ever to try to get myself back on track and payoff some horrific payday loan amounts."

I don‚Äôt want to be the anchor anymore so I‚Äôm gonna give up while I still have time to make it right. I need to be grateful for what I have and not fall back into the gambling trap.

Just for today, I know I will not fall into the trap known as gambling. Just for today I will remember the casino is the enemy. They do not care about me.

380,1,"Day 2Planning on going to GA tonight.  It‚Äôs going to be so hard.  I remember GA was something that came first in my life but I slowly drifted away due to complacency and a few months later relapsed.  

I explained in GA that it‚Äôs hard to build something to than destroy it and expect to build it again.  I was resigned to be a life long gambler.  I thought 18 months of abstinence could never be achieved again. 
Than I promptly relapsed a second time.

I heard there are new members in GA now.  One of the issues I had was that it was the same core 10 people and we knew our stories and the meetings felt repetitive but I‚Äôm learning that‚Äôs ok.

I‚Äôve also discovered the After Gambling Podcast and I‚Äôve binge listened to about 5-6 episodes yesterday alone.  I should start slowing down so I don‚Äôt go through all the content so fast.  As I was listening to his interview with a couple members, I thought I could be one of his guests in the future.  

I told my GA group I wanted my 1 year of clean time back.  I missed being able to talk with some authority and now I‚Äôm the one everyone is worried about.  I used to be the one worrying.  

The silver lining, if there is one, that I used to always say in my shares that GA worked so well for me that i felt a little depressed not finding it earlier.  If it was this easy, why didn‚Äôt I do this years ago?!  And also I never really could speak on the mentality of why someone relapses after doing so well in GA.  Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now wise enough to speak on this too.  Maybe I took one for the team to help others who  think they can start getting complacent."

389,1,"10 daysPatience and hard work, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking about right now. Both things that will eventually get me out of this. I don‚Äôt like where my business/career is, where I live, or the amount of free time I have.

It‚Äôs the quick fix, the quick amount of money to pay some bills or buy something nice that draws me back. I think, just another $1000 and I could pay off those bills, fix my truck, pay back someone I owe...etc etc, but then the addiction takes hold and I don‚Äôt want to quit without a win, and the win is never enough.

I immediately start doing the quick math and realize that I will be able to pay my bills and than there is relief.

But maybe it will sink in that I can‚Äôt do this if there is no relief. Maybe I need  to tell my landlord rent will be late.  Call the IRS and ask if they can hold off on taking their payment because I gambled the money away (what got me in trouble in the first place)  

When I started gambling again after 18 months I drove to a place about an hour away so I wouldn‚Äôt be noticed by any GA members potentially or friends/family.  I‚Äôm sitting at a machine with 600 dollars on it and I see my brother who is at this casino because he‚Äôs been 86‚Äôd from every other casino.

I wanted to contact IGA and tell them to help me but thought I would get into trouble with the laws about entering a pub I am banned. 
I said stuff it I am so sick of this I want my life better. 
So contacted them I had to send them up to date photo and they sent that and a letter to every pub I am banned at to remind them to be aware of peoples bannings. 
They told me I would not get into trouble awesome. 
So I feel pretty good now I would not enter a pub I know they know who I am. 
I would have gambled Thursday Friday gone but did not so I am 1 week 3 days in recovery I am happy feel confident. The pubs and online whatever gambling if some addict tries to stop themselves by bannings then they should be taken mire seriously and they should do there part.....

413,1,"Fired from job, big debtsSo I spoke of being ¬£35k in debt at the start of the year from gambling in another post . It caused me all sorts of problems, mentally and pragmatically. I live with my parents and have been really trying to move out since 2017, when I had to move back in due to a business venture of sorts that failed. I figured that I didn't make the most of my young years and want to make up for it ASAP in my old town. I'm a few years from 40.

Also, I won almost 35k back in jan which would allow me to move out. For days, weeks I struggled to get it paid out in full and in the end I did it back and more. Was gutted. I take full responsibility. So now I think I just have to do it the hard way over a year or 18  months or so at this job before moving out if I can. On hold again.

A week later, I was suddenly told that I might be fired from my job (unrelated reasons). And it that turned out to be true. I was let go earlier in the week. Maxed out on most credit at the moment, lucky I live with parents. There aren't many office jobs around this town, took me 18 months to find a suitable one last time after temping etc. But a manual labour job isn't going to put much of a dent in debt and I'll be here for years. That's assuming I can even get a full time position or two part time positions.

Bankruptcy is one option but would probably looking at a 3+ year restriction (due to gambling) which means garnished wages for that amount of time. Another thing is that I have a loan in someone else's name so bankruptcy would mean I couldn't pay them preferentially.

Couldn't have come at a worse time. If I would've known this a month ago I would've thrown my smartphone in the bin until those withdrawals were paid. No gambling since.

So yeah it's pretty much over now and I'm finding that I don't care, not in terms of gambling but in terms of life. Still want to make sure life insurance doesn't default. This shit all started in summer 2018 with the world cup. Then I got way in over my head (considering income I earn) chasing losses ever since.

I am very familiar with the addiction, am approaching one year clean from substances. Struggled with drugs and alcohol since I was a teen, turning 32 this year. Gambling has been a problem for a long time, but having made progress controlling my other additive tendencies, it now has my full attention. Lost tens of thousands of dollars over the past year. $900 today alone. Usually start with online poker then end up chasing losses at whatever table games the site offers. 

Narcotics Anonymous is a big part of my life, but I don't feel I am working a great program, not really working with a sponsor at all. I do attend several meetings a week. There is one GA meeting in my city I've thought about checking out. I feel so foolish, I continue to put the money on the sites, knowing full well I'm never going to see it again. It's not even the slightest bit enjoyable.

 I make good money, and have very few expenses or debt which is a huge positive. I am done with senselessly pissing money away for nothing. No more gut wrenching feelings after losing. Tomorrow is a new day, and I'm ready!"

428,1,"Oh dear - day zero againWell, I slipped.  After reaching double digits for the first time in two years I got overconfident.  I‚Äôve been sick off work all week and feeling miserable, my finances were looking better already and I thought ‚Äúoh it won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù to have a little gamble to entertain me and pass the time.  Well, it did hurt and my finances no longer look so positive.  

Does anyone else find their addition so infuriating but at the same time so fascinating?  I know that probably sounds weird, but in that moment of despair that I‚Äôm sure we all know where you‚Äôve gambled away you‚Äôre last money I find myself both in complete disarray but also completely fascinated by how I keep doing this to myself.  How a normally very rational and sensible person continues to do this, how my brain has been so hijacked by this.  I never thought in a million years that I would find myself in this position, but here I am.  

The thing that scared me about reaching double digits is that it seemed to be such a milestone but I really didn‚Äôt feel that much better for it.  I apologise if that‚Äôs discouraging to some.  

The good news is that spending too much time alone and at home clearly isn‚Äôt good for me, but I can‚Äôt really help being sick at the moment.  The positives are that I paid down some of my credit cards already this month and I should still have enough to get by this month, but I have trashed the little savings I had built up. 

I think I have convinced myself that I need to have savings for emergencies, but I think that perhaps I should just be using that money to pay my credit cards as having the pot of savings makes me too comfortable and likely to reach for it.  

I also think that I need to join a GA meeting at this point, it‚Äôs something I have toyed with but frankly I‚Äôm not succeeding in doing this alone and I should reach out."

433,1,"The beginning of my journey.Hello everyone.

I'm in a pretty bad spot right now. My finances are in absolute shambles, and I need to change my ways. I live in Illinois, and we legalized slot machines here. They're everywhere, and they've taken hold of me. I've gambled myself in to Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and I've screwed that up too. I had to refile the bankruptcy because I fell behind, and now I've fallen behind on my mortgage again. I can't seem to stop.

This is the beginning of my new life. I can't do this anymore. I will keep this thread updated as a diary of sorts to myself. I think it will help to come back to this thread and review what I've written, rather that go gamble and think everything will be ok this time. Any encouraging posts are appreciated as well.

As of right now, here's where I'm at:

I am in chapter 13 bankruptcy, and I am behind on the payments - I still owe for last month.

My mortgage payment is due for the November payment and I have received a note from my bankruptcy attorney asking why I haven't made the payments. They received a motion from the mortgage company. I am making the November payment tomorrow. I really hope I can make this work - I can't lose my home. I don't know what the options are at this point. Hopefully the attorney can hold off the mortgage company and buy me some time to catch up. But I don't know how I can even catch up. Between the bankruptcy payment and the mortgage payment, I'm tapped out. I don't have extra money. I do occasionally earn extra money for overtime, etc. I'm hoping to use that. 

My child support is being recalculated at the end of this month, and will very likely go through the roof. Thankfully, my attorney said that the bankruptcy payment can be lowered because of this, so hopefully that will work out. Otherwise, maybe it would allow me to qualify for Chapter 7 and convert it to start free and clear - but then I would lose my home. I don't want to lose my home. It may be the best option though at this point. Starting over sounds really attractive.

My other bills are paid up to date mostly, thankfully. 

I need to get a handle on this - get my mortgage sorted out, and get everything running smoothly. Please god, allow me the strength to make this work. I can't believe I've messed everything up again."

437,1,"I started again. I don't know what to do anymore.This is going to be a long post. I want to thank anybody who reads this so much.

So I'm hooked again. I don't know what to do. I know exactly why I'm addicted, It's not the fantasy of winng a million dollars, it's not the rush, it's not that I don't know how problem gambling works; I know I'm not likely to win, and even if I do, I'll just give it all back unless it's that absurd amount. It's because I feel completely powerless and terrified  right now. I see no way out of my situation without something terrible happening. I know gambling is only making it worse, I know I need to stop, that's the obvious part. The real question I have for you guys is, what the fuck do I DO? 

I guess I better back up a bit and tell you exactly where I am and how I got here before you can help me. Somebody who knows me might see this post eventually and figure out whp I am, but fuck it. Here's my whole situation:

This first part is just a basic introduction of things that will be important later. I have autism, and I've always had trouble socializing until the more recent years of my life. I had early triggers that are probably why my addiction 
happens to be gambling but those aren't important. I can tell you with certainty, if it weren't gambling, it would be something else, partly because of this fact. I hung out with almost exclusively the same few people from high school until my mid twenties because I thought everybody else hated me. I've always felt alienated, especially by women, and for a long time, I was bitter about it. Whenever a girl acted like she liked me in high school, if she was from a popular social group, I assumed she was fucking with me, and I genuinely couldn't tell the difference.

This made me only want to hold on to interest in one girl that was in my resource class in middle school, let's just call her Mary. Mary wasn't interested in me, ever. By some miracle, we're still good friends to this day, but I let it go from 6th grade all the way until my early to mid twenties that she was the only girl that would ever talk to me, let alone date me. I revolved my entire self-worth as a person around getting her to romantically have feelings for me. Needless to say, that was fucking stupid, and surprise surprise as approach the age of 30, I come to find out she had her own issues. Anyway, that's all I'll say about that for now. I thank fucking god I still have her in my life and I didn't turn into one of those incel assholes, but that's a different rant. 

The next major issue is an important one. I grew up with a loving, but very, very unstable and overprotective mother. To this day, she shows all the classic symptoms of borderline personality disorder, combined with extremely severe ADHD. When I was 12 years old, she did my homework for me before I had the chance to do anything myself, or to be more accurate, she got more into my assignment than I was. She was being perfectly nice until we were done, then said ""thanks for having me do your homework for you. JERK!"" then SMACKED me across the face as hard as she could. My uncle has autism as well, and he still lives at home at the age of 50 because of insurmountable debt from compulsive spending. My mom basically would use this as a justification to micromanage me my whole life, and on this day she went on and on about how she's not going to let me turn into a ""FUCKING LOSER!"" like him, and went on about things I didn't understand like welfare abuse. She would also threaten to try to go to a judge and get an adult guardianship over me when I was close to turning 18 so, you guessed it, I don't end up like him. This will come into play when I tell you about my actual addiction and how it progressed. 

So I guess my first brush with problem gambling was when I was 17, my parents got divorced. It started out pretty nasty; my dad was talking about having to move because he wouldn't be able to pay for the house we lived in on his own. Never happened, but it was a threat when I was 18, so I ended up buying scratchoffs. A lot. I had no credit card, and only working 20 hours a week at my crappy bagger job to begin with really kept me from getting into too much trouble. My mom was especially making threats around this time to take over my money, likely due to the fact that she was the one who moved out and she wanted an excuse to keep her parental control. It was around that time that  two of my best friends, Tom and Nicole started dating. I met them through Mary, and this major fucking BITCH got them to distrust Mary. This caused a whole falling between her and them out that ultimately lead to me completely stabbing them in the back to try to be Mary's night in shining armor. Spoiler alert: it didn't work, and I ended up (for now) losing two of my best friends and having nothing change with Mary on top of my home issues. I walked around town like a vagrant sitting at different gas stations buying lottery tickets every thursday night when I got paid for months.

So let's fast forward about 5 years. Me and Mary go to an anime convention and, at her suggestion, we went as Leon and Ashley from Resident Evil 4. For those of you who haven't played, a lot of people would consider that a couple's cosplay. I took it that way too, and told her I still had feelings for her. As you probably guessed, I took things wrong. After being rejected again, I started going to my local casinos a lot. So often in fact, that the dealers knew me by name. There were a lot of periods in this time where the dealers and the regulars WERE my social life. I would come to the craps table and the dealers would always be like ""Hey everybody look who's here! Everybody's favorite shooter!"" since I was one of those guys that would get real into it and make katate noises when I threw the dice and had a little victory dance and got the table joining in on it. If you're a former craps player, you know how it is. 

While my addiction got worse, I did begin getting closer and closer with Tom and Nicole, who were still together at the time. It got to the point where my casino was giving me free hotel stays, and eventually I'd have them stay with me a few times. We'd get drunk and play old video games on a shitty early 2000's computer monitor we bought from goodwill because the stupid TV's in the hotel there blocked you from changing the input. We had a lot of fun and those are still some of the best memories of my life. It all changed one day though.

One night after a lot of drinking, let's just say 18+ things happened between the three of us. We began to make it a regular thing while sober, and while Nicole wasn't sure about it at first, she started to say things like ""I could get used to this!"" and things like that. Then one night at the casino, they got into an argument and went out to the parking lot. All they told me was that it had to stop after that, but it continued only a few days later. After that though, they would get into fights more and more, and I had no idea what was going on. Finally, they stopped talking to me and after two months of no contact, I confronted Tom. Tom told me that Nicole really didn't want it and was only doing it to make us happy because she didn't like confrontation. Something about this didn't sit right with me, but I took it at face value and blamed myself, beating myself up every day. I would hang out with Mary still every couple weeks, but for a while, the casino was my social life, period. 

It was at this point that I was going every single day. I would get there at 6:00 in the morning sharp so I could play while they had the daily mini-jackpots in the poker room up, play for 5 hours to get a free buffet, I'd usually then go out to the main casino, play craps until I either won a ridiculous amount or busted, and by the time it was said and done, it would be 6 in the evening. I'd be there filling up on nothing but the free soda so copiously available and the nicotine in my vape. There were times where my fingers would start to tingle because of this, but again, I'd keep playing until I lost all my money. 

Eventually, I sent an email to Tom and Nicole, pouring my heart out to them, saying how sorry I was. I felt sick sending it, and I remember I didn't send it until a poker tournament started. I actually placed that day, so I didn't read it until the tournament was over. They replied saying it was okay, that they weren't mad and they were sorry how they handled everything and that it wasn't my fault at all. They wanted to reach out to me but they were too anxious themselves. Unfortunately however, they were about to move three states away; I only saw them once before they moved. I was forgiven, we still talked over text, but I was still on my own.

Eventually, I won a jackpot for 3k and gave it all back and then blew my whole paycheck. I had 2 maxed out cards leaving me with 4k in debt. That's when I said enough was enough and signed off. I had a paralegal degree at this point and for once I felt like I had a future after all. At this pont, at 26 years old, I was working at walmart living at home with my dad. I was paying my debt off and avoiding my mom like the plague because I was fucking terrified at what would happen if she found out I had credit card debt. She would go through my phone randomly if I left it unattended because my younger brother would pressure me to buy him booze, and I've always had to be very guarded around her. ""I'M. YOUR. MOTHER."" I can hear her voice now. I told her about the gambling, but never the debt. 

Eventually, I made a roadtrip to go visit Tom and Nicole. We reconnected and had a really awesome time, but on the last day I found out some things. 1.) Tom and Nicole were getting divorced. 2..) Tom was suffering from serious depression himself and dealing with serious weed and alcohol abuse. and 3.) Nicole had been a lesbian this whole time without realizing it, and hence, she was so back and forth about everything from before because she was in denial and very codependent. Her dad really messed her up by being a heavy drug user when she was a kid. I guess you can add 4.) That their relationship was way more toxic than I had realized. Tom became more and more mentally unstable having to continue living with her, and she was forced to kick him out with the only place to go being back to my hometown with Nicole's parents. I had to talk him out of suicide several times until my mom overheard me talking about it when I was helping him through an episode. I indicated he almost hung himself, and she called 911 and had him sent to the hospital. After this, Tom and I both moved in with my mom. Tom had a more stable enviornment, but it came with a price.

At this point, I had been gamble-free for a year and a half, with the exception of buying a 5 dollar scratcher on vacation once, losing, and being like ""yup. This is why I stopped."" The stress of living with my mom, however, changed this. She had violent moodswings, she said one thing was ok for Tim to do one day, but then the next it wasn't. Strongly suspect her husband had something to do with it. It was not a good recovery enviornment for me. I had planned to pay off my debt and save up for a downpayment on a condo. Turns out I was buying a condo sooner than I thought; my mom and dad cornered me when Tom was at work at his new job, and sat me down saying we needed to find our own place and that Tom's stay was limited. This was done in a way that was out of the blue and again, contradicted what she just said the day before, and again, when her husband was home. I was ganged up on. There was also something new I had to hide in addition to my credit card debt.

Some time after Tom moved in, I was comforting him after he was having a nervous breakdown. Well, that turned into an adult situation. Now, I'm a straight guy, I've never been in an adult situation with another guy before. Well it turns out he'd wanted this for a while. The thing he and Nicole were fighting about in the hotel? He realized he might be gay. For me. That's the real reason they were fighting and I had no idea. How did I feel? I don't know. I still don't. I never had time to make a decision. After being pressured to move out, here were my options:

1.) Call the whole thing off when we already had a real estate agent and were making an offer. No way I could tell my parents what happend; Mom would make Tom out to be the bad guy because ""My baby's not gayyyy!""

2.) Move in with Tom, rush into a relationship that I'm not sure if even conforms with my sexuality or not, without fully paying my debt. You know, the one that I'm scared shitless to tell my mom about? 

3.) Move in with Tom, see him every day, and act like that just didn't happen. Not only would this be awkward, it would be way too hard for Tom who just went through a divorce and has secretly had feeling for me for years. 


I chose Option 2. This is when I relapsed to gambling. I started again one day when I stayed at my dad's house for the night. Last time I was there I had a horrible sleep paralysis episode that made me afraid to even try to sleep there, so I stayed up all night, took an adderall, drove 10 miles to a bitcoin ATM, and went to a bitcoin casino site. It started out as a tournament here, a poker game there, but it went from 25 a week to a couple hundred a week, to being fully hooked when I moved into my condo with Tom.

Know how I said I was paying off my debt at a good rate? Yeah, that got them expanding my lines of credit. Without me even asking. In the year and a half I was gamble free, one of my credit cards went from being a 3.5k limit to an 8.5k limit. Unsolicited. I lost my shit one day and maxed it all out. Almost overnight, I was 15k in debt. I banned myself from the sites I knew about, got a second job to keep up with bills, and in three months, I had it down from 15k to 12k, and had 1k left over for the month. I was doing good, but spent a lot of time working. Tom was upset by this, and because of his co-dependent relationship with Nicole, thought I was avoiding him because he was conditioned to think that way for so long. 

Eventually, three things happened: an expensive car bill, them cutting my hours at walmart due to department restructuring, and me feeling bad for working late. I was in the mindset at this point that I need to turn off every other part of my mind, pay off all my debt as fast as possible, and take care of it before my mother finds out about it. When I realized I was in trouble and was gonna be broke for the month, guess what I do? Ask for help from my parents? No. That would make mom look into my money more. I didn't want any questions. Then I look at my old email box and see an ad ""You got free spins!"" on some site I signed up for way back when that I forgot about. It was all over. I stopped paying my bills. I said ""fuck it. I don't care."" 

So at this point, because of my scheduling with the new system at walmart, in order to keep my second job, I'd need to work 7 days a week. I'm working day after day for 2 months, no days off, 4am to 1pm at walmart, 6am-2:30 PM at my other job. Blowing all my money as soon as I get paid, not even having enough money to buy a candy bar on break.

Eventually, I get a job offer to be a paralegal, I take it, but I'm still hooked. I'm working from home, gambling whenever Tom's not around. Eventually, I get a notice of foreclosure. I some how miraculously get a loan modification. This scared me off gambling for another 5 months. Then my boss got sick. I had to work at walmart again, overnight, 6 months till I got rehired. I go crazy and gamble again. Haven't missed a mortgage payment thank god, but I have multiple payday loans out. Not the super bad ones, but the ones that you borrrow like 500 and pay 600 back two weeks later. I need help. But I'm afraid to ask.

Here's my ultimate problem: I still haven't made a decision on whether I want to be with Tom or not deep in my heart. I haven't had time. I've been doing nothing but put out fires. If I tell my parents about us, I'm locked in. If I don't I can't get help. If I leave, I don't know if that's what I want either. I have no options.

The extra money, the whole day free, the feeling that I owe myself a little ‚Äúharmless‚Äù fun for working so hard...the wheels started turning. 55 days ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have given it a second thought. My ass would be gambling all damn day tomorrow losing god knows how much money, no doubt about it. But you know what? 55 days ago, I lost $8,000 dollars over a couple of days. 55 days ago, I felt like absolute worthless shit. 55 days ago, I had lost all self control over myself and the value of money. 55 days ago, I flushed $8,000 just days before Christmas. And 55 days ago, I started posting here. I am doing the right thing for myself today though as I promised I would do 55 days ago.

They of course were wandering why the hell I would need financial help considering the decent paying job I have. Instead of lying and weaseling out some lazy excuse like I may have done in the past, I came completely clean about everything. It felt good despite their extreme disappointment. Idk this time feels different...I‚Äôve self excluded myself from all online accounts, have put heavy barriers up to be able to even access any online sites, and have given my parents access to my bank accounts to be able to monitor my spending. I‚Äôm just so done stressing about this bullshit for no reason. Today is Day 1 for (hopefully) the last time."

447,1,"24. Admitting my problem. Need advice.I have a gambling problem. I've known it for a while, but now it's become serious. I feel as though I'm truly on the edge of a cliff right now. I'm so close to falling off, but I can still turn my life around.

I'm 24 years old. I have 2.5k (gambled away about 15k) in the bank and no debts. What I've come to realise is that there are many people who have been in the position I have, continued gambling to win back their losses, and lost far far more, only to then look back at when they were 24 with 2.5k and no debt and realise that they had the opportunity then to turn it all around, but squandered it.

What I want, what I NEED, is for someone to give me clear motivating advice. Tell me how it's only downhill from here and how I'm lucky now to have the opportunity to better my life. I know it but I need to hear it from someone. I want to read it back day after day and use it as motivation. If there's anyone out there who was in my position, but then continued to gamble and feel they fucked their life up beyond repair, just know that you can essentially save mine.

This is it. I'm writing this post because this is the final straw. I know that I can turn my life around now. But I need you help.

God bless all of you."
448,1,"So deep in the holeI‚Äôm so deep in the hole that no matter how much I win I know it won‚Äôt even be a drop in the bucket to what I‚Äôve already lost.  I‚Äôm in this perpetual chase mode where it‚Äôs absolutely guaranteed I won‚Äôt catch up so why even try? And it will always be this way.  I say instead of trying to climb out of the hole by gambling which is going to be a fail, why don‚Äôt we climb out of the hole by dedicating our lives to accepting being a compulsive gambler and being of service to other gamblers who are suffering.  

I swear I sometimes think life would be more enjoyable being of service than getting all the money back.

Thanks for reading"
449,1,"That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm done.I gambled and lost about 30K in the past year and half. This is insane. I have 8K on my credit cards + 400 loan from a friend.

I never won, I just lost money constantly. In the past two weeks I managed to make 9k. That was enough to at least cover my cards and have few hundreds extra.

I always complained that I never won so this time I gambled bigger bets, like 5 and 10 per spin. I should have stopped when I made those 9k, pay the credit and start over again. 

Well, no. I just lost 2.5K in the last hour. So instead of chasing that loss, I am saying STOP THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW.

If i would have just stopped one hour ago, but no, I wanted more. I always complained that I never win and that I could stop if I win, but it‚Äôs not true. I can see it clearly now. It‚Äôs no stop to this unless you really STOP FOREVER. 

I though oh so if I play slots on higher bet I can make thousands... yeah, sure. And you can also
lose thousands in one hour.

Why the hell I wasn‚Äôt happy just to be able to pay the cards and that‚Äôs it?! I wasn‚Äôt because I am sick. This is a disease and I am very sick of it and I suffer. I have to stop NOW.

Instead of chasing again that loss, I will be grateful that at least I have something on my cards, I can buy some food or whatever.

So now I need to be calm and not reverse that pending withdrawal and wait until the money are in my account and leave it at that. 

Maybe I could win another K if I risk it, but guess what, FOR SURE i would have had 30K that I lost. I would have those money but I wasted them at gambling. Fkkk this shit, Im done.

Three times in the past two weeks I‚Äôve had the 8-9K and I could have pay the CC and leave it at that. 

But no, I wanted more. It was a hell of an emotional rollercoaster. I played in the bathroom at work, I played at home hiding non-stop. Sweating and smoking and wasting hours and hours. It‚Äôs midnight and tomorrow I will be again exhausted at work.

Fuck this shit.

Fuck it forever.

In five months if i‚Äôm not smoking and I‚Äôm saving I can pay the rest of my credit cards and that‚Äôs it. 

I‚Äôm not going to risk now another 2k to try cover the difference. I will cover it by working and saving, like any norma person.

Imagine if I would have had 30k in my savings, instead of nothing. I am so stupid!!! I was happy that I won 9k. I didn‚Äôt fucking won anything, I lost 21k in total!!! Well now more than that, because I blow out 2.5K in the last hour!!! So it wasnt enough for me and it will never be enough, now I understand.

Fuck this shit.

Next week I will do the math and I will start saving, pay the cards and my friend and leave ot at that.

In 10 years I will be fine that I lost these 30k. But if I don‚Äôt stop now, in 10 years I will have half of million debt and my husband will divorce and I will be homeless.

So let‚Äôs leave it at that. 30k. Fine. Maybe more, maybe 35? Who knows.

Leave it at that. 

It was a very expensive lesson to learn but I need to stop NOW.

It‚Äôs clearly a disease. How the hell one hour ago I was happy that at least I can pay my cards with my win and start saving, just to see myself deposit another 2k. Jesus!!! 

I could have bought an exotic trip for me and my husband with what I lost in the past hour. Only a sick person can do that. 

I will continue posting and do the math.

Im so stupid.

Day 0. Enough is enough. Done with smoking, sleepless nights, smoking and anxiety. That‚Äôs my salary and I will make a living with that, like any other normal person. 

For the past year and half I am constantly broke and worried and lying and all that. Fuck it.

I am NOT going to reverse the pending withdrawal, I will be happy that at least I stopped while I still have something on my CCs and that‚Äôs it.

Fuck it forever, it‚Äôs the biggest scam ever. Stop.

I know the amount stated in the title isn‚Äôt a lot, but I‚Äôm so fucking sick of turning a ¬£30 deposit into ¬£120 through research and stinginess with my bankroll, only to run it up and become reckless thinking I‚Äôm a gambling god.

All I know is, the urge to gamble my losses back after my most recent loss was strong but (thanks to this page) I sat with it. I realized the strong urges are momentary and collectively probably only add up to a few minutes throughout my day. Do I wanna give in to a few minutes, chase my losses, or do I wanna rebuild and move on with my life.

Over the past few years I would overdraft my personal account constantly!  I would know if I wanted to gamble and didn‚Äôt have enough money, I could deposit it in my online gambling account and it takes a few days to be taken out from my checking account. But My gambler mind would think I could win that money and replace it anyway.   Nope!  I would lose it all and now be in the negative. I then got the stupid idea to get cash advances at one ATM and then run to my bank on lunch break so I could deposit that money to avoid overdraft fees. Here I am a middle aged woman, professionally dressed anxiously waiting in line. Feeling so anxious and impatient for the line. When I would finally get to the teller to deposit, I would wonder what they were thinking. Here I look so well put together and if they look at my transaction history. It‚Äôs all just gambling site transactions and over draft fees. I did this for weeks. Look at this pathetic woman. Always running to deposit money and get overdraft fees anyway. Pages and pages and years of that. I hate even looking at my past bank statements now!  But for the last few months, I‚Äôm in the positive!  And now those transactions show paying off my cc debt. So there!  I don‚Äôt feel like an asshole anymore and I‚Äôm slowly chipping away at the debt and feel great. F&amp;ck Gambling."

My balance this time was 7k! Time to cash out and quit gambling I said to myself, cause I promise before I would if I have this kind of luck to get my money back. So I requested the withdraw but this site required verification if you withdraw money from them and even after that it takes 2-3 days before I see it on my account, nothing new to me I just needed to send them papers next day. So as you know you can cancel the withdraw at any time, so I did that night and won another 3k!!! My balance was 10k, I feelt like nothing can stop me!!! and thought I can do this forever............nope. that night i cancel the withdraw and start getting greedy by betting big, after a short time 0 balance and it only get worse, the next 2-3 days I began the chase with the other 5k I won, only this time I withdraw amounts directly from my bank account and losing everytime to the point I lost that 5k plus what was left, I feelt depressed before like everybody but the last days I feel like never before depressed, everything I do feels so exhausting I wake up wishing I haven't, work seems like I'm moving weights cannot concentrate on nothing thinking on how I can be so dumb and selfish, that's why this Monday i nationaly exclude myself from all gambling online and in stores so I don't auto destroy myself later."

They said this was a ""good idea"" but not currently possible and that I should submit it as an idea through their feedback mechanism. 

This pissed me off, but also gave me a nudge of motivation to push them to put this feature in and I submitted the feedback saying how i thought adding self-exclusion would be in line with their Code of Conduct policy. My plan is to send the feedback once a day and keep at it over time. 

It may sound like a bit of a downer, but I don't have high hopes that they'll make the change. I think there is too much money in it for them and the app developers. However, I still feel like it's a worthwhile thing to do. I feel like some good will come of the effort even if google do nothing. 

I've created a facebook page to document how things unfold fb.me/GooglePlayGambling If you're interested, I'd appreciate you giving google the feedback, visiting the facebook page, and letting me know how you go with your request for google to be more socially responsible :)

Retirement money... Safety net... Gone. Sigh... 

Nevertheless, I still have a few pennies in my savings account and suddenly my precious sanity is back. So there‚Äôs that. Truly grateful for many things. I‚Äôm not homeless (from my insane and reckless not to mention drunken gambling outings), the frig and freezer are full, I have loving family and friends and a quiet peace that keeps inching its way into my life. I accept the great losses. I do, it‚Äôs gone. I still feel the financial pain but my peace of mind the last 43 days is PRICELESS. Perhaps this is what‚Äôs keeping me urge-free. I just don‚Äôt want it anymore, that gambling life, it‚Äôs not who I want to be. I accept my addiction and I know it will always be there. I simply cannot place one single friggin‚Äô bet. Ever.

The downside is that I had kind of hoped the urges would dissipate, but actually they seem to have gotten a little stronger the past few days.  Frankly I feel like I miss gambling, the buzz etc, and I can feel the weight of my abstention on my shoulders somewhat.  

However, I‚Äôm proud of myself and determined to drive on like this.  I have recognised a few more triggers for me, one of which is definitely being hungover - hangovers destroy my willpower to do (or not do) anything.  I have wanted to drink less anyway, so it‚Äôs a good reason to do that."

I‚Äôm celebrating the day by working, because it brings me one more day towards paying off my debt.

Working on the emotional too. I‚Äôm going to eat a healthy meal and exercise tonight, and then I‚Äôll probably play my guitar for a while. All simple things I stopped enjoying when I was deep in gambling. For me it replaced a simple, rich life with lust and greed. It makes my life feel cheap and hollow when I‚Äôm in the throes of addiction. Here‚Äôs to all of us, those in recovery and those who are thinking of putting gambling behind them.

He has always been an honourable man. And he is heartbroken over what this addiction has done to me. I had been hiding it for so long, but worked on fixing the addiction. I am feeling great as I‚Äôve moved past the suicidal thoughts, hopelessness and my weight has been lifted. That took months for me to get out of the darkness. He has only been aware for a week and it‚Äôs a lot to take emotionally for him. He is looking into therapy himself. I also set him up on his phone with Addiction Support podcasts. I think listening to them has made him sad. Or maybe he‚Äôs just trying to cram in too much healing too fast. I think he needs to take a break from it.

504,1,"Does the itch ever fade?I have been working on quitting for about 2 months now and so far I haven‚Äôt been overly successful to be honest but I am not giving up on beating this monster. 

I do have a question for you long timers though. After 100,200, 300 days... Does the urge fade? I know it‚Äôs always creeping in the background but does it get easier?"
505,1,"Day 5 without gambling.Reminded myself that everyone woke up this morning with one thing in common...we all have the past behind us and a brand new week ahead of us. We can make this week whatever we put into it. Work hard, play hard, go after your goals, and enjoy your life, and spend the week without engaging in any destructive behaviors.

Oh, and if you need a reminder that you are alive, go look at the full moon tonight. Guaranteed to be more fulfilling than looking down at the next bet you would make when you were gambling."
506,1,"Day 1: I‚Äôm ready to recover. How do I keep showing up when Day 1‚Äôs confidence drifts?I am a compulsive gambler. It started with throwing in a dollar and betting nickels and quickly escalated to dropping twenties and maximum bets. Last Friday, I received a hefty paycheck that I worked my ass off for - I paid some bills, and then went on a three-day bender, spending nearly half of my paycheck, in addition to all of ‚Äúwinnings‚Äù. My family feels used, my cabinets and fridge are empty, I‚Äôm behind on utilities and medical bills, my credit is going to shit. Just like my bank account, I‚Äôm depleted, overdrawn. Last night, I finally had a breakthrough by writing down the amounts that were put into machines in just three days, and letting those written numbers sink in - staring at them point-blank and recognizing that only I am accountable for them. I‚Äôve come clean to my loved ones. I‚Äôm ready to take GA and the words from my social worker and my psychiatrist seriously. I‚Äôm ready to be able to provide for myself. I‚Äôm ready to not go two weeks before being able to breathe again. I‚Äôm ready to love myself like I deserve to be loved. I‚Äôm ready to show up and confront this addiction like I never have before. I‚Äôm not going to forget this pain because I never want to feel it again. And I‚Äôm fucking terrified of relapsing. I recognize that it just happens sometimes, but I‚Äôm afraid of my impulses taking over like they so often do and falling right back into the pit. The fear is as heavy as my being ready - I‚Äôm afraid of putting so much pressure on myself that I turn right back around to self-sabotage. I also know it could be a lot worse, but I‚Äôm tired of justifying. What steps can I take to give myself grace at this time and in the times to come? How can I remain mindful and present when today‚Äôs confidence drifts and the temptation slithers back in? What can I do when every molecule of my being is telling me to just do it?"
507,1,Day 8Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£
508,1,"Hi, I‚Äôm new in the r/problemgambling family. Just saying hello and my story.Well I guess this is is. My first official day in which I am seeking out help. Found this community through my own research, and actually the first community I‚Äôm joining on Reddit. I‚Äôm fairly new to Reddit so please bear with me.

This will be a long post, I‚Äôm sure or it, hope you guys won‚Äôt be bored from it. I‚Äôll try to take you through everything I‚Äôm going through and how it all started.

I‚Äôm a 27 yo male from an eastern European country. Casinos and booking agencies can be found at any street corner in my country. So, naturally, my story begins with an 18 year old me trying pokeys for the first time in my home town with a few friends. I hadn‚Äôt won anything the first time, but losing the first amount of money didn‚Äôt sit too well with me. I kept trying to get the money back and finally decided to quit trying as I was sick of the feeling that I had afterwards. Never thought of pokeys or gambling again from 18 years old until I was 22, now in college with a few friends from my dorm which were regulars at casinos. Extending me an invitation to go with them to a casino very close to our dorm, I went, and just as I went in I remembered of that short period of a few weeks that I gambled when I was 18. 

Now to not take up very much of your time and to not make it boring, I gradually started raising the amount I gambled in search of big wins. Always had my mom help me with money when I hit rock bottom several times. Always lied that I needed the money for something else, I just couldn‚Äôt get the nerve to tell her that I was an addict. And, actually I always hid myself from that and was always lying to myself that I can just quit one day. I had a period of about 7-8 months in which I did not gamble at all but, as I‚Äôm sitting here writing this, you can all guess that I relapsed.

The current situation is quite ugly and I‚Äôm just sick of it, feeling like I‚Äôm only dweling deeper into lies and debt just to fuel this addiction and chase for money. I have about ‚Ç¨6000-7000 debt collectively from bank loans and friends and family lending me money. Though it might seem that it‚Äôs not that much money, for our living standards it‚Äôs a lot. I will start a plan of splitting my income and prioritize clearing the debt.

I‚Äôm mostly worried about my mental health as I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety and high levels of stress and over thinking situations for so long that I often feel that I‚Äôve lost the ability to feel things and enjoy life. I don‚Äôt know any feeling other than the anxiety driven one, and can‚Äôt enjoy anything life has to offer to me. 

This will change, hopefully starting now. With the help of you guys and everyone here.

I was not this person before gambling, and I am NOT this lying, frustrated, piece of shit that is only sorry for himself and childish ways of trying to make ends meet. I‚Äôm sick of having these dark thoughts and suicidal tendencies. Wish I could enjoy life like I did before I had this in me. I‚Äôm tired of feeling down and alone.

Thanks for listening to anyone that made it this far, and I‚Äôm open to any advice, anything can help me as I feel that today I really hit rock bottom, emotionally and mentally, and I want to save myself from myself.

Also very interested in money management to help me get started into paying off my debt.

Wish you a wonderful day ahead, everyone! Thanks again for listening and you can comment here and even PM too, I‚Äôll try to respond to everyone that contacts me. I hope this post will make me some new friends that won‚Äôt judge me for what I‚Äôve become and that we can beat our addiction together!"
509,1,"Feeling My Feelings*I used to escape life and try not to feel. I was trying to mask my emotions with gambling.*

*Once I got clean I had to face those feelings head on. This can be scary but not impossible.* 

*Just For Today I will feel my feelings.*

My name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. I saw the above on Twitter, @ podcastrecovery and it really got me thinking and when that happens I tend to write. I‚Äôd also like to point out what an amazing resource @ podcastrecovery is, from their interviews with those in recovery (including me - [https://www.buzzsprout.com/189733/1671886-mark-r-a-bet-not-worth-placing](https://www.buzzsprout.com/189733/1671886-mark-r-a-bet-not-worth-placing)) to their daily posts that always give me something to think about or something to share with another person in recovery. I know a lot of my writing has been focused on what I did in the past and when I gambled, which I still feel is important, but I also want to try and focus on recovery and my progress, or attempted progress which is also, in my opinion, important for me to get a handle on.

So, I will begin by reflecting back before my gambling really began as I feel like I really struggled emotionally during my teenage years. I don‚Äôt want that to sound like I had nowhere to go with any problems I had because that‚Äôs not true, I had both my Mum and Dad who if I had a problem would have been there to listen to me, help me and advise me, but I generally wanted to keep everything to myself. Why did I do this? If I‚Äôm being completely honest, I have no idea. I guess that‚Äôs why I like to reflect on things, see if I can figure out the answers to these puzzles in my head.

It‚Äôs funny how certain things stick with you, but I remember starting secondary school and a childhood friend of mine ended up going to a different school, we would have played together all the time for years and years. Long story short, I messaged him (on my Nokia 3210...fuck me I‚Äôm getting old) and told him I don‚Äôt think we should play together anymore because I am in a different school and I think it would be best to end the friendship. From what I recall he was pretty gutted to get the message and couldn‚Äôt really understand but I had made my mind up. Why did I do that? Again, I have no idea, but I am wondering if it is somehow linked to my emotions and personality. Maybe I felt if we weren‚Äôt seeing each other all the time then there was no point in me putting effort into the friendship as I wasn‚Äôt getting enough out of it. That feels like a theme throughout my life now I think about it. If I move on from a job for example, people I would have been really close with, going out together all the time after work etc, would cease to exist as far as I was concerned. I would not put the effort into maintaining those friendships as I knew I would make new ones when I went somewhere else and I would get what I needed out of those friendships. I think I needed to feel like the people who I was friends with were there for me, like I needed to not only know that they liked me but I needed to see that they liked me through our interactions together. If a friend couldn‚Äôt hang out or play with me I would genuinely feel devastated, like I was rejected by them and they no longer liked me. It would play on my mind until we next hung out and I would fear the worst, that they didn‚Äôt like me, that I had done something wrong and wondered why they chose that other person over me.

*Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face*

*Bruce Springsteen - Dancing In The Dark*

That brings me on nicely to the fact, when you break it all down, I was a people pleaser and desperate to fit in with those around me. I would be the person I thought they wanted me to be, the person I thought would make them stay with me. I was like a chameleon, I would blend in with the person I was with by talking about what they liked, said what I thought they would want to hear. I did that long enough that soon I didn‚Äôt actually know who I was, I was this fraud of a persona I had created that everyone seemed to like, but deep down inside I had no idea who I really was. I feel like that‚Äôs why I loved gambling so much, it became a friend of mine, a friend that was always there for me. None of my other mates, when I first started gambling, were into it, so it was just my thing, but looking back it did feel like a relationship. A secret, long term, intense relationship with ups and downs but the thing was, no matter how many mistakes I made, no matter how many bad times I had with gambling, it was always there for me. It never abandoned me for someone else, it was the perfect vehicle for me to escape in. In gambling, especially online, I had something that was there for me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. It would bring me so much joy and also pain but it would stand by me. I‚Äôm aware this sounds a bit delusional but it‚Äôs how I felt. I don‚Äôt think I had a deeper connection with a person on this earth than I did with gambling. That‚Äôs when I started to withdraw away from other friends and social activities because gambling was the one thing I wanted to spend all my time with because I got the most out of that relationship, or at least thought I did. I was able to find a high I couldn‚Äôt get with another human being, I was able to ride this roller coaster of emotions that never ended, unless I ran out of money of course. Even then I could do research about gambling, think about gambling, talk about gambling, no matter what, it was always on my mind. When you add in to this mix the fact I met my partner during this relationship with gambling and we had two kids, gambling became like this secret love affair I was having. It got to the stage where I didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone about gambling because it was my thing and mine alone but more importantly I knew I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone because once the secret was out I would lose the thing I loved the most in my life...gambling.

*Till some day they'll just cut it loose*

*Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down,*

*Bruce Springsteen - Darkness On The Edge Of Town*

Eventually though, I realised that this relationship was destroying me mentally, physically but maybe more importantly, emotionally. I knew I had to get out and the only way was to reach out to someone and ask for help. That person happened to be my partner and she didn‚Äôt abandon me, she stood by me and gave me the opportunity to enter recovery alongside my kids. Although, when I entered recovery I was raw, I didn‚Äôt know how to act, what to do, what to say or how to say it. Would these people accept me? Would they want me? Would I get what I needed out of them? When I walked into my first G.A. meeting I had no idea what to expect, well, I kind of expected a bunch of old men sitting around desperate to gamble and they would spend all night trying to convert me to a religion. Instead, I was welcomed, then taken to the side, asked the 20 questions and basically told ‚Äúyeah, you belong here‚Äù. So I sat and listened to the people who spoke before me and I got so much from what they said. They went out of their way to make me feel special, ‚Äúyou are the most important person in the room tonight‚Äù they said to me. Then it came to me and they said I could share if I wanted, it was up to me. I just took a deep breath and thought ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and started talking and didn‚Äôt stop until I felt like I had gotten through my whole story. It felt amazing and strange at the same time, like, I was opening up to these complete strangers and telling them stuff I had never told anyone before but I knew they understood and I was buzzing when I left that meeting, I immediately knew I belonged and wanted to go back.

*Passionate ‚Äì Beneath Adventurers‚Äô quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.*

*Taken from Adventurer personality on* [*https://www.16personalities.com*](https://www.16personalities.com/) 

These intense feelings when it comes to relationships or connections with people is who I am, it‚Äôs my personality, and if I don‚Äôt deal with it properly it can cause problems like it has in the past. I am starting to learn more about myself, that I have this personality that when I get caught up in something exciting or interesting then nothing else matters to me. It explains a lot why gambling and myself were the perfect fit, no matter the outcomes it was always exciting and interesting. I have noticed that bleed over into my recovery, I absolutely love recovery, meetings are exciting and interesting, new people who come in are exciting and interesting, I can see myself being intense when it comes to my recovery. That‚Äôs ok to a point as well, as long as I am aware of this trait and I am able to pull myself back enough so it doesn‚Äôt become a problem.

*Fluctuating Self-Esteem ‚Äì It‚Äôs demanded that skills be quantified, but that‚Äôs hard to do with Adventurers‚Äô strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers‚Äô efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.*

*Taken from Adventurer personality on* [*https://www.16personalities.com*](https://www.16personalities.com/) 

This of course, is where it can become a problem and low self-esteem is something that I have struggled with for a long time and that has continued in recovery. I know those I have connected with appreciate me and what I bring to the table but as I have said before, I struggled to believe in myself. I spoke about my concerns with those closest to me in recovery and I am feeling a lot better about it all. The important thing to take away is that I reached out to talk about how I am feeling, even if that seemed alien to me when I entered recovery. I‚Äôll be honest, it still feels difficult to do now but I have learned in recovery that HOW is vital, Honesty, Open Mindedness and Willingness. The ability to reach out and ask for help is one of the biggest differences I have noticed about myself since entering recovery. This is why a support network, for me at least, is so important because you never know when you will need them. I felt at my lowest in recovery 300+ days after my last bet, I had no desire to gamble, I was just struggling emotionally. The old me would have buried those feelings deep down but I didn‚Äôt because, through listening to others in recovery, I knew how to tackle these situations. I was lucky in the early days, things were good but what I didn‚Äôt do was sit back and enjoy the ride, I got stuck in and learned and developed the tools and skills I would come to require later in recovery. I am always trying to learn and develop and push myself forward as a person but at times my emotions get the better of me, and that‚Äôs ok. This addiction isn‚Äôt a financial problem, it is an emotional one and I need to learn how to feel my feelings.

I reckon there will be more to come from me when discussing my feelings going forward in my recovery as I am beginning to respect how powerful emotions are, at least for me. I‚Äôll leave it with something that an old hand in my G.A. room says when he‚Äôs sharing, ‚Äúwhat does all that have to do with gambling?...Everything‚Äù.

512,1,"Day 93, It‚Äôs Rough...It‚Äôs been a while since my last post... I‚Äôve stayed clean, just haven‚Äôt found the time to make posts. It‚Äôs been 92 days since my last bet and life‚Äôs hitting me like a brick wall. Part of me feels like a bet will relieve some of this anxiety but I know that all it takes is one bet to pull me back into an even worse life. 

The past 92 days were easy when things were going well. Settled into my new job and loved it. Social life has been going great too. Paying down my debts and watching the mountain slowly shrink. But past week have been filled with stress from all of those facets of life with my debt constantly in the back of my mind. Hoping this all passes soon because I‚Äôm really feeling some strong urges lately. 

Just wanted to make a post before my day starts and commit to no gambling today. That‚Äôs all I can do for now..."

I'm 101 days clean!

There's been very tough moments like going as far as downloading the app on an online poker site.

Moments when I was convinced that I'd just put in 1,000 into my trading account - this would have turned out really bad.

I don't know how I was able to overcome those moments. But I think counting the days - thanks to this subreddit - has been pivotal. Consciously or subconsciously."

Did any of you guys have that same experience winning the first time?

day 0"
520,1,"Day 51 and gratitudeI often try and decipher what exactly was my motivation to gamble. At first, it was just for fun without any real expectation of winning but then it became necessary because I just knew I would hit that life changing jackpot one of these days if I just kept playing and having faith. I needed to become rich so I could finally be happy. I had to keep playing. My life was in limbo until I could win the money to ‚Äúturn it all around‚Äù But looking back, I don‚Äôt know Wtf was so wrong with my life then? I have a family, friends, my health, a good job, a home, and clearly I had more than enough money since I was able to flush so much of it down the drain. Wtf did I think was so wrong with my life that I had to gamble so much for a better one? It‚Äôs crazy to think that by simply being grateful for the life I had, all of this could have been avoidable. Greed is what fuels gambling and being ungrateful for what you have fuels greed."

522,1,I took a new step. Just closed all 3 of my online accounts.Never been able to do that before.
523,1,Day 62
524,1,"I wanted to say something.I was at the casino this weekend.  I was sitting beside a young lady.  She started talking to me.  She was happy, having fun, bubbly, she said I just started playing 3 months ago.  She said she won on this very machine.  She said she only plays a small amount of money.  She said her friend is a nurse and she is really bad! She puts in twenty after twenty, ""Thats crazy.""  I said that is like me.  I wanted to tell her that it is a progressive disease.  You start out making small bets, eventually, you want a bigger rush, you want a bigger win.  You will do anything to stay in the zone. It felt like this was a message for me to snap out of it.  Leave! Stop! but I was already in the chase.  I'm very emotional today. Gambling hangover. I know that this will pass after a few days. I have been reading and commenting and It helps. It helps to know that others are going through something similar, there is no judging, and that I am not alone.  Thank you for your support."
525,1,"I gamble to fill voids in my lifeI have severe ADHD so find it hard to put work in school/career so I feel like I'm underachieving in my life. I lie to my girlfriend, not about important things but just anything and everything (and idk why I do it). I'm not as attractive as I'd like (though not that bad I think lol). I'm incredibly lazy, and have lots of anxiety. And sometimes gambling just gives me the only rush. I'm not depressed, but I'm not content or happy with my life either. If that makes sense. 

Does this resonate with anyone else on here? Thanks"
526,1,"Day 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£Went to church today, I had one of those moments where i felt the preacher talking directly to me. He was talking about what are the wounds and struggles we have in our lives... and do we choose to pour salt on them (like salt on a slug) or choose to heal them via love and caring for one another?  Love you all!"
527,1,"Gamban is saving my lifeHow easy it would be to just throw away more money if Gamban wasn‚Äôt available. At least once a day I feel the urge to pick up my phone and log on to one of my old gambling sites. Chances are, I would‚Äôve done it already if Gamban wasn‚Äôt on my phone and computer.  And then I‚Äôd be right back to lying to my husband and wasting my life away. Barriers are a must in my book. 
Day 7, baby."
528,1,"MoodpathA little thing that has helped me enormously is recording how I feel daily. I started this before I quit gambling because my anxiety was through the roof and I wanted to log how I was feeling to show the doctor. Anyway, I still log my days, it asks you morning, noon and night, you pick a mood for example, good, bad, very bad, very good etc and you write a little diary entry. This has really helped me to quit and stay away from gambling, this is because I can look back at my days as a gambler and see all the times I went to the club and when I lost (95% of the time) and the correlation between my anxiety and bingo/slot losses is just as you would expect, gambling was making me physically ill. I re read my diary entries all the time, going back to those moments when I was so lost and desperate. It really helps me so just wanted to share. The app is called Moodpath, it gives you results every couple of weeks and there‚Äôs also an option to download a pre written letter to hand to your doctor if you need it, this outlines any signs of depressive episodes etc. This sounds like I‚Äôm being paid to plug it haha but I love it, you can see your daily mood on your calendar by the colours, green means good, blue means bad and grey means very bad etc, you can glance at a whole month and see what mood you had each day. I had no greens for a full 5 week period and that makes me sad. I now have nearly all greens for the last 5 weeks and that is something I never thought was possible. Just thought I‚Äôd share with you, it may help someone. Keep up the good work everyone xx"

I fucked up so bad I had to open up to my sister so she can lend me money so that my girl doesn‚Äôt find out because I‚Äôm almost positive she would leave me. It‚Äôs selfish I know but it‚Äôs time to turn it around. I‚Äôve never felt this bad about it and never had this close of a call. also my car payments due, idk what i‚Äôm gonna do but I just want to make it through tonight. This is the second time my sister gave me money, the first time I didn‚Äôt elaborate on why I was broke but this time I just had to tell someone. It feels like i‚Äôm losing the battle.

538,1,"A Strange NightI have a poker problem here.  Last bet on Dec 31, 2019 and haven't been back to the Casino since...almost.  The last 5 weeks have been great: better eating, better working, better sleeping, etc.

Yesterday was strange though.  It was a friend's birthday and she insisted on hosting at the Casino club.  Afterwards, everyone wanted to ""go gamble a bit.""   I managed to avoid the poker room, but we ended up around the craps and other table games.  I made a few bets, actually left with some money (of course losing overall) after a reasonable amount of time.  I didn't feel any kind of rush or excitement from those games.

However, just being there made me want to go play poker so badly.  I actually became somewhat irritated during the other games, maybe even a bit snappy because the poker player in me knows that ""the odds are stacked against you in all those other table games"".

I'm not really sure how I'm feeling right now.  Just wanted to write it down.  I'm pretty happy without playing poker in life right now, but I definitely recognize the urge."
539,1,Would waste a thousand dollars at a stinky lighted music box almost weekly. Beating my demon one day at a time. Noticed this $5 bouquet and gave it a second thought at first- shows how skewed your brain becomes when gripped by gambling. These flowers have brought me more joy than a slot ever has.
540,1,Day 1Relapse is the main problem :(
541,1,"Day 168Love u guys. Seeing lots of high numbers on the sub and lots of people just starting out, which is great to. Y‚Äôall have a gamble free Saturday"
542,1,"I am a compulsive gambler.I feel so bad. I had excluded from the casino nine months ago.  I was doing great, until January.  I knew my exclusion would be ending soon.  I felt anxious and went to the local pubs a few times, thinking I would get the bug out.  Well my exclusion ended on wednesday.  I couldn't wait to get to the city and get in action.  I really thought I was in control.  In fact I was way out of control.  I spent more than I had saved up in two days.  I kept chasing and just couldn't stop.  I feel so horrible.  I know this feeling well.  I can't talk to anyone, no one knows the horrible lows but others here.  I could just cry!"
543,1,"Time to change.Hi guys. This weekend has been my worst ever weekend. 6-7K lost, terrible beats which leads me to more tilt and trying to chase with higher amounts. I feel sick. Now is the time I think I call it quits with gambling, I think it is the underlying problem to alot of my stress, weight gain, and becoming a recluse, Only 23 years of age and my life revolves around sports betting. Time to change while I can and not become completely broke and in debt like I see so many stories on this sub reddit. If anyone has any suggestions on how to battle this would be great as I know it's going to be tough and I'm going to be urged to bet ""just one more time""."
544,1,Day 2I‚Äôm going to keep track of every dollar spent from now on.  I will spend like i only make half of what I‚Äôm making right now and save the rest.  No more wasting money on gambling.   This is my plan and I‚Äôm going stick to it.  Will check in here everyday. Thanks everyone.  If you have any advice please share.
545,1,Day 61
546,1,"Day 50 and an old sayingWhenever I would bring home winnings from the casino, my friends and family would always say, ‚Äúyou always win! You‚Äôre so lucky! How are you always winning money?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt win if you don‚Äôt play.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I would say. The dumbest lie in the world. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt win if you don‚Äôt play.‚Äù

Of course everyone thought I was winning hundreds, sometimes thousands every time I went to the casino because I only ever told them about the wins and NEVER about the massive losses, not the amounts or the frequency or the fact that my losses completely negated any wins that came my way. It was all a lie. A lie I told to others and to myself; that I harbored some kind of special skill or luck they didn‚Äôt and was making money hand over fist every time I entered a casino. 

It feels good to finally shed that lie. The next time someone asks me about whether I‚Äôve won anything recently or when is the next time I go win some money as if it is a set default now, I‚Äôm going to say ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt lose if you don‚Äôt play.‚Äù That‚Äôs the real truth of gambling anyways. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt lose if you don‚Äôt play.‚Äù

Happy 50 days to me!"
547,1,"Day 41I travel for work, and am able to come home 1 week every month as I choose. Unfortunately, this is where I‚Äôve developed my addiction. On this trip home I did something different, I went to the casinos that I frequent most and excluded myself from both of them. It felt great! The one young lady working security told me I am very calm, and seem at peace. She was right, I‚Äôm very happy with where I‚Äôm at in my gambling addiction and couldn‚Äôt be more confident in my decision. To everyone fighting out there, keep fighting. Read a book, go to a meeting, have someone hold you accountable. It‚Äôs really hard to do it alone, but keep fighting!

Cheers,
Jake"
548,1,"Day 2, finally told my family and it all just feels like an attack.I get it, I‚Äôm 1000% in the wrong here. I finally told my family the spiral that I‚Äôve been going down the last 5 months. Prior to that I hadn‚Äôt gambled in years. 

And now it feels like they are attacking me and just asking how we got here again. I know I screwed up and screwed up bad, but now this reaction has the guilt on complete overload. I don‚Äôt want any of this. Maybe I‚Äôm better off not being here and not being this burden. This addition just takes away all of my good qualities anyways."
549,1,Day 8Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£
550,1,"Back to day 1Made it 1.5 months gamble free. Couldn‚Äôt overcome the urges today. Battled them for 8 hours and gave in. $350 lost at the casino. To be honest, probably good I lost and didn‚Äôt win at all. No bonuses- wasn‚Äôt even fun. Literally got destroyed on the slots."
551,1,Day ü•â
552,1,"My storyJust blew 1000 euros away last night online. 3500 last Friday in the casino. Been like this for many years tho, everytime I tell myself it's the last time, but hey who am I kidding right? 

My problem is paired with cocaine, which makes it a lot worse I guess. At the time being high and gambling you feel you can take on the world and won't think of the aftermath, however the next day you feel like a piece of shit and the regret sinks in. I'm laying here in bed hungover thinking the same shit as most of you, that I gotta turn my life around.

I know I cant get my money back and I accept that. Probably spent over 250k in de last decade, but I'd rather not think about it and look forward, with a positive mindset. 

I got a lovely wife, a 9yr old kid and a new baby is on it's way. That should be enough motivation for me to change, so far it hasn't. I'm not in the position to go to rehab so I gotta do it by my self and perhaps with the help of you guys. 

As we speak I've closed all online accounts, asked for a ban in the local casino, installed gambling blockers on my phone and computer and finally deleted all the phone numbers of drugdealers. Hopefully no more relapses! 

I just wanted to share this and if any of you have some advice, please spit it out."
553,1,Crazy to think...Crazy to think What gambling makes you become im pretty sure we are all good people inside because your intention with gambling is to never hurt anyone if anything to better everyone around you and yourself. I‚Äôm so deep in a hole burned all my bridges with people to borrow money I almost done the unthinkable today. I was almost willing to meet up with a guy let him deposit fake checks into my bank account to get a $1300 of $4000 split between 3. I drove to the parking lot an hour early of meet time sat there for an hour and cried thinking about what I was about to get myself into I have a son and people that care about me yet I was so desperate for money I was willing to put myself in a position to commit fraud and maybe jail time criminal record and ruined bank account history for at least 10 years. This is a serious disease I told my mom  and my sons mom about what I was about to do today so they can know how serious of a problem I have and monitor me more heavily . I have to do better my son needs me the most now he‚Äôs about to be 3 next month and starting school this year. I make descent money working two jobs just have to be PATIENT and I know a month from now I‚Äôll feel much better. Just posting because I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first person to think about doing some kind of bank scam it‚Äôs not worth it you‚Äôll end up gambling that money and owing whatever cut the scammer took stay away from it we are better than this. I‚Äôve done the true game changer today I‚Äôve handed over my iD (the only gambling I do is the local casino playing blackjack) I can no longer even think about going as I‚Äôm 28 but look young and get carded a 100 times out of a 100. Take every step possible people we can do this but only if we really want it. Less tears more smiles one day at a time.
554,1,Day 133
555,1,"Just some thoughtsLet‚Äôs say I will gamble now and I‚Äôll win 1K. Great, but someone else lost those money. Someone is maybe thinking to end their life because they just lost everything and there is no hope anymore. 

Truth to be told, the casino is always winning, but other than that, each win is actually a loss for someone else. These amounts are not falling from sky, but from our pockets. 

And my brain tries to trick me saying ‚Äúyeah, now feel guilty that you have a job and someone else is unemployed‚Äù. It‚Äôs not the same, really it‚Äôs not.

Basically if I would make tonight 20K this would be someone else‚Äôs saving account, pension plan or credit card. 

Gambling is a horrible horrible addiction! I never had in my life such a difficult challenge. I have an addictive personality, but I was able to stop whatever, not the gambling. Not yet! 

I don‚Äôt want anything more in the world right now than place a bet. Thinking that I could make some money. I would trade an exotic vacation to just sit an play slots on my phone hoping to win big. 

How insane is this? 

My biggest challenge is to have again the value of the money, of each dollar. How can I bet hundreds of dollars in half an hour? I‚Äôm not rich to afford such an expensive hobby!

If they ask me at work to do overtime, I feel like it‚Äôs not worth it! Am I to work long hours for what, $200 more on my pay check? Not worth it! I can win $500 if I‚Äôm lucky in 5 minutes. 

Truth to be told, I lost thousands of dollars... And to chase that definitely means I will lose more. 

Even if you win 10K it‚Äôs still nothing. Because then you always think that you can do it again. And the entire salary for one month will feel like nothing. After 30 days just 2-3000?! But I can win that in one night, if I would just be lucky enough.

That‚Äôs definitely the most insane disease and addiction in the same time. Probably same as heroine, but I don‚Äôt know since I never tried. Thank God!

I just hate hate hate the day that person invited me to the casino. Why you would invite someone to try slots?! Because you‚Äôre ignorant and you don‚Äôt think that someone could develop an addiction, you believe everyone is like you, able to play 200 dollars on an annually trip to casino just for fun.

My life changed with that stupid trip. 

Since then, I lost thousands. I don‚Äôt even want to say the number. 

I lost all my free time, my peace of mind, my normal life. Constantly lying and hiding and stressing and planning and counting debts and how to struggle until the next pay check which I already knew how I will spend on the first day.

Believe me that I went for days not eating anything at work because I had no money left, and my partner obviously thought I am eating... 

I didn‚Äôt even sent Christmas cards to my friends and family because I was broke. 

I am writing this and the rational me knows that I need to stop now and forever. But in the same time I don‚Äôt want anything more than placing that bet... maybe this time I will win the jackpot!

Insane insane insane. I don‚Äôt have another word for this.

I am afraid that eventually I will stop, only to blow my pension money in 20 years from now. Maybe I‚Äôll have a bad night when I‚Äôm older and I will play my mom‚Äôs house. I don‚Äôt know.. it‚Äôs insane. 

I feel this is like smoking, you can stop for 5 years and then you suddenly light a cigar and you‚Äôre a smoker again, like you never stopped.

Not to mention that after 1,5 years, that friend said ‚Äúwe should go to the casino, remember we had fun that night‚Äù.

Oh yeah I remember, I will never forget that night that transformed me into a monster and twisted my mind.

How do I get rid of these thoughts? I just want to forget that gambling exists. At all! 

Starting life over at 40... basically accepting I‚Äôm a loser. A loser that without gambling has no chance of getting rich, and with gambling having ALL the chances to be broke forever.

And it‚Äôs weekend, how I will stop myself. 

Please stay strong everyone and keep sharing your stories. We need to learn from our mistakes! God help us!"
556,1,Day 1Last gamble was about 2 hours ago on blackjack online. Never again. I will beat this addiction. Hope everyone else is doing good.
557,1,"The Promised LandMy name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. I‚Äôve talked a lot over the last 24 hours about my emotions with those closest to me in recovery and it‚Äôs got nothing to do with gambling urges, it‚Äôs about me and how I feel about myself. It‚Äôs about what goes on in my head now, in recovery and the thoughts that I have about myself.

The bottom line is I don‚Äôt believe in myself and this is something I have struggled with for years. The problem comes in recovery when I can‚Äôt see what I bring to the table and there is a negative voice in my head that tells me I am not good enough to help others and I am not good enough to help myself. One thing I really enjoy doing is writing, but I feel like my writing is shit and I don‚Äôt read it once I post it because I am so self critical. I just struggle to believe in myself. I think I am also scared that this is the real me, that I believe the old me is still in there somewhere waiting to come back out. Then I also find myself thinking this person I have become is full of shit and is a fraud, that what I‚Äôve done while gambling, the person I was, can‚Äôt possibly change and become a better person.

I think a lot of it could also come down to a fear of failure, that I believe everything I do is shit and therefore when I fail I‚Äôm not disappointed. That can become a self fulfilling prophecy and for me I feel like it has. I also fear taking a leap of faith because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll make a mess of things, hurt people again or hurt myself. This me, in recovery, is something I have not been used to before, someone who is honest, who has nothing to hide, who wears their emotions on their sleeve and someone who actually wants to help not only myself but also other people. I now care about other people and that was never the case in the past. Maybe I am looking too far into the future and thinking of forever instead of focusing on today. Maybe it has been such a radical change in a short space of time I am struggling to get to grips with it and process it all.

What I do know though, is I know the positive impacts I‚Äôve had on people in recovery because they have told me. I know that people think I‚Äôm a good writer because I have received amazing feedback and I also know that people like me for me...this me in recovery...the real me because if they didn‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt have the connections I do with people. So although logically I know all of these things, I just don‚Äôt feel them and I then get lost in my own head and feel worthless.

In the last 24 hours I have had some really good talks about it and I‚Äôm going to do it...I‚Äôm going to believe in myself, embrace this new me and push myself forward. I know I can offer something to people out there, I know I have improved my own situation and can keep improving it. I‚Äôm ready to buy into this version of me and although I am sure I‚Äôll have the odd moment of self doubt and make a mistake, I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm not letting this hold me back from what I want to get out of my recovery. If I continue to be honest and do the right things then people can think what they want about me, I don‚Äôt need to worry so much about what everybody else thinks (although that is a personality trait of mine but that‚Äôs another blog). I am taking that leap of faith‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve also been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen, as I feel I can relate to so much of his lyrics. As was said in the film Blinded By The Light, ‚ÄúBruce is the direct line to all that is true in this shitty world‚Äù.

I feel like his song ‚ÄúThe Promised Land‚Äù has two choruses that sum up how I was feeling and what I have done about it.

*I've done my best to live the right way*

*I get up every morning and go to work each day*

*But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold*

*Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode*

*Explode and tear this old town apart*

*Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart*

*Find somebody itching for something to start*

I‚Äôve spent the past 10+ months trying to do the right things each day and I get up each day and work my recovery. Maybe though I did go blind and couldn‚Äôt see the good I was doing for myself, my family and those around me. I feel weak all the time like I‚Äôm not good enough and I want to explode with self hatred, explode and tear my recovery apart. I have had this pain in my heart and it‚Äôs emotions that I don‚Äôt know how to handle because I have never dealt with my emotions properly in my life. I just forced them deep down inside of me and, to be honest, hoped they would fuck off somewhere else.

*Well there's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor*

*I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm*

*Gonna be a twister to blow everything down*

*That ain't got the faith to stand its ground*

*Blow away the dreams that tear you apart*

*Blow away the dreams that break your heart*

*Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted*

This next chorus is perfect for what I did to address how I was feeling and this is why, for me, it‚Äôs so important to build a strong foundation of recovery. I may not have had the answers myself but I knew I had to reach out and talk about how I was feeling. Connection is the opposite of addiction and being able to reach out and ask for advice and not only that but to be able to listen and take on board that advice is what helped blow away my issues and allow me to think in a more clear manner. It‚Äôs often said you need three things to work a successful recovery and that is HOW...Honesty, Open Mindedness and Willingness.

*The dogs on main street howl*

*'Cause they understand*

*If I could reach one moment into my hands*

*Mister, I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man*

*And I believe in a promised land*

It‚Äôs clear for me, recovery is my promised land and it‚Äôs somewhere that I belong and somewhere I can thrive if I want to let myself thrive. As someone told me today, the only person who didn‚Äôt believe in me was...me.

558,1,"Day 49 and barriersI had a few urges to gamble today. It‚Äôs not unusual after I‚Äôve been working a lot. I used to ‚Äúreward‚Äù myself with a trip to the casino in the past when I‚Äôd put in extra hours, take on extra projects, etc. Now is when the barriers I put in place really help out. I want to gamble but I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no agonizing over it or fighting back and forth with the impulse. I. Just. Can‚Äôt. Self exclude if you haven‚Äôt already. TGIF, everyone!"
559,1,The last timeI have wrote here before but I continued to gamble. I am ashamed of myself. I lack control even though I know what I‚Äôm doing is terrible. Week after week it‚Äôs the same thing. I vow I am done. I already took the first necessary step by deleting my account. I don‚Äôt ever plan on having to pay a book again after this collection day. I am so ashamed of myself I look at myself as a loser. Does anyone have any good recommendations on a book a movie or something that can help teach you the art of self control. Or any kind of GA meetings located around New York City
560,1,"Very disappointedHi everyone, feeling very disappointed in myself as I had managed 100 days gambling free. My son looks after my money but I pay the bills. 
Last night I had access to money. I have been working extra hours to pay back debt. Well I gambled all of the extra cash. I am now going to be late paying back my loans and will have to make the dreaded phone calls to the bank. 
I‚Äôm very disappointed in myself. Feeling anxious and dreading the next month."
561,1,DAY 87!yes 87
562,1,"My first post here was a year ago. I'm not going another year of constantly resettingI'm making this post so that a year from now I can come back and see how far I've come. Day 1 today. Good luck, everyone."
563,1,Day 3434 days clean!
564,1,"Day 5! But I don‚Äôt feel greatReached a five day streak finally, it‚Äôs been a long time since I managed that and I‚Äôm proud of myself.  I have had some urges which I have resisted, but generally it hasn‚Äôt been too bad.

The kicker is that I don‚Äôt feel better.  I use the ‚ÄòI Am Sober‚Äô app to track my days and it says that lots of people who reach 5 days report increase happiness, more energy etc, whereas I just feel a bit sad to be honest.

I think it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôve been keeping myself very busy the past two weeks which has helped me reduce gambling significantly.  But today I‚Äôve had a very quiet day at home, and my mind has wandered.  Just trying not to slip up."
565,1,"Don't know how to overcome the hopelessness hurdleBasically the TL;DR version is that I'm seeking others' experiences (what helped, what didn't help, etc) on the title topic. I added the ""trigger warning"" flair since I'm not sure specifically what it refers to, but I suppose this whole post could be considered a bit emotionally messy. 

The longer version..

I'm in my early 30s and have never been 100% financially independent. Really rough childhood, messed up adolescence and then a very rocky start in adulthood. Have always worked dead-end low-wage jobs, mostly in retail (have applied for better jobs, but have never been accepted). Have had to go through some bad experiences/places to avoid being homeless multiple times in my life.

At some point in my mid-20s I started to feel very hopeless, and then also panicky. If at any point my biological mother were to cut off support (periodically helping me make ends meet), I would be royally screwed. I don't know how I would make it. And we've never had a great relationship. So I live in constant fear/dread in the back of mind. 

It was around that time that I started playing the lottery in order to get a sense of hope back and calm my nerves. Even though it was only temporary, it was at least something. I rationalized that it was only a few bucks a week on just one of the draw games. In between the drawings, I used the ticket in my pocket to give me that sense of hope, no matter how far fetched, which helped to keep me going in life (showing up for my awful retail jobs, mainly). 

The problem is that this cycle developed and just became more intense over time. I'd have a sense of hopeful calm right up to the drawing, and then of course wouldn't win, which would immediately lead to feelings of despair and dread. Those feelings wouldn't ease up until I'd buy my next ticket. 

So this cycle unto itself started stressing me out, losing over and over again. My knee-jerk reaction was just to give myself more chances. Buying more tickets at a time, and for all of the draw games. I needed another 'hit of hope' more and more frequently. I needed it everyday, but also multiple times per day. If I didn't win the state draw game(s) earlier in the evening, there was still the chance that I would win the bigger one late in the evening. 

Obviously this never happened, so I just became even more panicky as time went by. I just felt more hopeless and less in control of my fate. So then my brain turned up the stupidity volume to 11, and I started picking out my own numbers with the mentality that I could use strategies to increase my chances. This shit *never* worked, but somehow still made me feel better. 

Until it made me actually feel worse, anyway. Because on top of being hit with sudden, intense waves of despair/dread every nightly drawing, I would also be angry with myself for 'failing' to pick the 'right' numbers. I'd feel stupid, but for the wrong reasons.

So fast forward to present day, some years later, and despite at least having *some* self-insight, I still have a problem. I dread the dread, basically. That hopelessness/despair and feeling powerless to improve my quality of life. I still spend way too much on the lottery, as it's still the only thing in my life that can give me temporary relief. I may not spend a lot compared to some people, but it's a lot compared to my income. 

Absolutely nobody in my life knows how much I spend on the lottery every week/month. People think I have at least some money saved up, but I never do. The thousand or so that I could have set aside over the course of a year, instead goes right into the lottery. When my biological mother thinks she's paying for me to get a cavity filled (since I have no insurance), instead I'm buying lottery tickets while my back tooth just keeps rotting.

Pretty much the only aspect of my life that I won't currently sacrifice for playing the lottery is my pet. I take his care very seriously, but that's literally the only thing in my life that I still care about more than trying to win the lottery.

Thing is, whenever I don't play the lottery, I get *severely depressed*, very fast. The feeling of despair becomes overwhelming/suffocating, and I start to feel like I'm going to have a severe nervous breakdown or worse. I haven't found any other way to relieve it. Not even drugs gave the same relief when I admittedly tried some of them.

I just have no idea to how to overcome this hurdle. I tried therapy twice, and in both cases, both therapists just focused on trying to get me to change my feelings by changing my thoughts, but I wasn't able to change either. Like they would say positive but vague things to me about being able to improve my life, but the specifics were never more significant than things like eating a bit healthier or practicing meditation. 

So I'm sitting here late into the night having just blown more money on lottery tickets, predictably didn't win, hating this feeling and desperately wanting out of it, but also having honestly no idea how else to make it go away aside from buying more tickets tomorrow."

One part of my head tells me if I can just win that back it will be like it never happened. How fucking delusional, it‚Äôs like I think I have a time machine. Continuing the destructive behavior is not a time machine, it‚Äôs insanity. Today I will choose sanity."

Thanks heaps everyone!"
576,1,Day 189The last week of so the guilt of what I've done has crept back a bit. I realise I havent forgiven myself fully yet. I'll be raising this at my next meeting but thought I would post on here immediately. Has anyone else encountered this feeling coming back after a period of time. I can see my debts coming down and the 2 smallest ones have nearly cleared which will release some disposable income but the feelings of what could have been have came back.

581,1,"A New StartHello fellow Problem-Gamblers, 

I've turned to this sub with high hopes. I am 25 years old, approximately $18,000.00 in debt and am totally addicted to gambling. I live in Las Vegas, and have no plans of moving anytime soon. If anyone is familiar with Las Vegas, you know that it is almost impossible to avoid gaming machines. They're in the gas stations, grocery stores, bars, almost everywhere you have to go to maintain a normal life. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 8-9 months I have spent no less than $15.00 gaming, daily. I cannot seem to stop myself from putting a $5 or a $10 or even a $20 note in the machine every time I see one, regardless of my financial situation, which is poor and getting worse everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I opened an account at betterment.com so that I can send any available cash to just sit there and earn tiny interest, don't really care how little it earns, as long as I can't get my hands on it.  I see this as a big move in the right direction.  Day 2 feeling good so far!"

591,1,"Ego - Part 3: Megalomaniacal...My name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. This is continuing on from my last two posts about my ego and will look at Megalomaniacal thought patterns a penchant for exaggeration and dramatization mainly focusing on the time during my active addiction.

*Megalomaniacal thought patterns - Having high expectations of oneself is a healthy and productive frame of mind. However, spending a lot of time thinking about how one‚Äôs greatness will far exceed anything conceivably realistic is not healthy or fruitful.*¬†

*Penchant for exaggeration and dramatization - As mentioned, egotists have an insatiable desire to make themselves appear important to impress others. As such, they‚Äôll often exaggerate and dramatically overstate various aspects of their life. If an egotist perceives their life‚Äôs progress as inadequate ‚Äì a common characteristic of such people ‚Äì they‚Äôll embellish anything and everything in order to make up for this ‚Äúgap‚Äù. Should someone call them out, they‚Äôll frequently overreact in a desperate attempt to get people to buy whatever they are selling.*

**Megalomaniacal Thought Patterns**

The definition of megalomania, taken from the Cambridge dictionary, is ‚Äúan unnaturally strong wish for power and control, or the belief that you are very much more important and powerful than you really are.‚Äù I feel like it will be easier to break this down into two separate parts to dig down further into how it relates to me during my active addiction.

*An unnaturally strong wish for power and control*

Reflecting back, I feel like I have desired control over my own life for a very long time, probably from when I got into a relationship with my partner but that grew stronger when we had our first child. It wasn‚Äôt that I just wanted my own space because I was afforded plenty of space and time to myself, it was that I felt my life was no longer my own, that my partner and my kids came before my needs, which is obviously the way it should be. I believe I struggled to grasp this concept and gambling online offered me the perfect escape into a ‚Äúworld‚Äù where I felt that I had all the power and control. As long as I had money to play I didn‚Äôt have to answer to anyone in my gambling world. I could get lost in various countries via various sports. The thoughts of what winning would bring, with what I could do with the money that I won, they were all happy thoughts. Obviously now I know I would never have done anything with the money but at the time it allowed my mind to drift off and imagine how much better I could make things. Plus, if I was responsible for making things better for my family then they would be grateful and appreciate me, even though they already did. Of course, when the addiction really took control and I was in debt and was trying to hide this from my partner I was scrambling for control over everything so the secret wouldn‚Äôt come out. Hiding mail, making up excuses for having no money, whatever it was I was desperate to control those situations and come at my partner from a position of power if a conversation ever arose. I could even make the point that my ‚Äúfinal act‚Äù in active addiction was because of my strong wish for power and control when I finally admitted to my partner I had a problem and needed help. I would rather have gone out on those terms over being caught as in my head, I felt like I was on the front foot and in control. I blindsided her with my admission and was almost prepared for any questions she may have.

I would often daydream about being a famous singer or sportsman and would think about all the fans I would have who would be cheering for me and looking up to me. I liked that idea of being in demand, of people liking me and wanting me. Like if I was listening to a song I would think of myself singing it in front of people (I can‚Äôt sing for shit by the way) or watching sport and thinking that could be me (yet to find a sport where it could be me). I spent a lot of time wishing I was in a more powerful position in life than I was in.

*The belief that you are very much more important and powerful than you really are*

‚ÄúI don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal. People know me. I'm very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany.‚Äù Those are the words of one Ron Burgundy and apart from the leather-bound books and apartment that is how I viewed myself. I expected people to treat me with respect and to appreciate everything I do, especially at home. If I did the dishes I expected my partner to organise a parade. If I vacuumed and mopped she better get a Bank Holiday in my honour. Then in arguments I would throw things I did back in her face, making out that without me the house would fall apart. At that time I believed it as well, I thought I was the one who was hard done by and wanted to make sure my partner knew how important I was to the household. If I messaged a friend I would expect them to reply straight away because it was me that was talking to them. If they didn‚Äôt I could feel myself getting more and more frustrated. On the other hand, if I was gambling and didn‚Äôt want to be disturbed and my friends kept messaging me I would get annoyed and started shouting at the phone that I am busy and mute the conversation. Of course, when I finished my gambling I would try and start the conversation up again because it was on my terms. In work I did absolutely nothing for years but yet I believed that I was an important member of staff and not only that but I deserved to be working at a much higher grade because I was so much better than everyone else, even if I wasn‚Äôt putting in the same effort.

**Penchant For Exaggeration and Dramatization**¬†

When I first read the above it I thought ‚Äúfinally, one trait I didn‚Äôt have‚Äù but on further reflection I think that it could be the trait that was at the forefront the most during my active addiction and that‚Äôs because I was pretty much living a double life. When anyone asked how I was my response was always ‚Äúdoing well‚Äù or something equally positive and short and sweet. I didn‚Äôt want them to know that inside I was drowning, struggling to stay afloat, not only financially but also mentally. To be honest, I don‚Äôt think I wanted myself to know how bad things were and wanted to believe that everything was fine and gambling will make it even better. If anyone asked me about why I had no money, usually a friend I was trying to borrow money off a week after payday or my partner asking why when asked to buy a loaf of bread in the shop I needed to borrow ¬£10 off her to get it, then I would become desperate and overreact to get what I wanted. Instead of messaging a friend to borrow ¬£100 until payday I would have this full story typed out with reasons why I needed it, how an emergency came up, all this other total bullshit, as I believed it would help me in my quest to borrow money. Same with my partner, except I would tend to overreact if she asked me why I needed money. I would throw things back in her face that I had bought or how I give her money each month, how I hardly have any money etc, anything to get her to stop asking questions and give me the money.

I would also just flat out lie to my friends or my Dad if they asked me about my gambling. They weren‚Äôt trying to find out if I had a problem, they were just asking if I had done a bet at the weekend for example. Instead of telling them about a bet I actually did (obviously I was past the stage of telling them exactly what I was betting on as they would probably have me locked up) I just lied about a bet I didn‚Äôt do at all. If it happened to be around the time I had no money to gamble I would lie in that instance as well that I had done a bet. In my mind I wanted to keep up the idea that I gambled ‚Äúresponsibly‚Äù because that's who I had become in other people's eyes. I was someone who gambled and if I lost that part of my image I had nothing to offer anyone.

593,1,Day 8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£
594,1,"Day 1.After being active on here and making a post today about the massive casino going in at Tacoma, WA, I went to a small local casino and sat down at the blackjack table. It all happened so fast, 15 minutes after getting the urge I was there putting the chips down. Even after hitting a bonus for over $1k I still walked away $900 down. Not that the dollar about matters.

I felt stronger than ever that the end of 2019 would be the end of gambling. It was part of my identity. I looked forward to seeing that number of days go up every day. But it still happened, and it goes to show that I still didn‚Äôt build the adequate barriers and I hadn‚Äôt healed the parts of me that needed to be healed. 

I kept thinking about GA meetings but I never actually went. I haven‚Äôt told anyone close to me about my addiction. I haven‚Äôt taken the steps that I really need to take to stop this for good. 

Maybe sharing this with others will help me and possibly help them. Hopefully, because I see people posting on here making the same mistakes I do. Yes, you can get angry after a loss, but that doesn‚Äôt last. 30 days later you aren‚Äôt angry anymore, you begin to forget. I‚Äôm not ever going to forget again! This sucks so bad, 10 years of my life are gone. I want to live fully in my best version of myself. Thank you all for your support, I‚Äôm going to bed now and tomorrow is a new day."

597,1,"Day 47/48Has anyone ever thought about what the casino workers must think of us? I‚Äôve had a few of them try to chat me up while I was playing, asking whether I‚Äôd won anything, things like that. I‚Äôd respond abruptly, dismissive smile and nod most of the time and then right back in the zone. Rather fucking rude on my part in hindsight ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I wonder if they would watch from afar, looking at the numbers going up and down, taking in how much money I would mindlessly pump into a machine, watch my non-reaction even as I won from time to time, never cashing out. I wonder whether they pitied me or really thought I could afford to lose so much. It‚Äôs a weird feeling to think back and acknowledge that there was an active audience of non-gamblers watching me at my worst."
598,1,Day 131
599,1,"Day 1 again - relapsed after 11 monthsDay 1 for me officially. I was gambling yesterday morning so I can‚Äôt count the miserable sleep that I got as a day. 

I‚Äôve had many 1st days and they are all difficult to get through but I‚Äôve somehow managed. Found this community, The After Gambling podcasts and my Church and other Church podcasts for support. 

I had 11 months and threw it all away because I didn‚Äôt proactively treat this disease. So once it (compulsive gambling) found out I was weak it pounced on me and there I am, right back where I left off. Luckily I stopped before my last dollar was gone and didn‚Äôt get in deep with my credit cards.

This disease is so powerful and conniving. It takes over all your rational thinking and it makes you think what you are about to do is fine. After all the work we put in to not gambling. The disease says it‚Äôll be different this time, you can control it this time. The disease says you need this because you‚Äôre stressed out or bored why don‚Äôt you go numb your brain and win some money. 

I heard a really good thing today on The After Gambling Podcast, Jamie is the host, he said relapsing is part of the healing process and just because we relapse doesn‚Äôt mean we are starting over. It means we have a lot of tools we‚Äôve learned through the days and months and years of not gambling. We can use those things we have learned and add more tools to overcome our addiction this time. 

Thank you for listening and sharing. I will be checking in daily."
600,1,"Day 38. Never stepping foot in this monstrosity, except maybe to self-exclude. This is under construction in Tacoma, WA all paid for with drained savings accounts and broken dreams."
601,1,"Let's face it. Gambling is a ponzi fraud and we got suckered in.If you think about it. Each bet can be a relatively modest stake compared to an e.g jackpot. So a ¬£2 stake to win e.g ¬£500 would attract people who seek a good return on investment.

However, we have a weakness in that we only initially register each single bet/spin as being affordable. It's only ¬£2... what do I have to lose?    A lot, as it turns out.

With playing one bet/spin at a time, there is no sense of accumaltive damage... even though you know you are burning through $$$ it doesn't seem to register.

We have to see gambling for what it is - the world's worst investment scam. Time and money down the pan, never to be seen again. Not by us at least. The industry grows rich, never us. 

Our credit scores never go from crap to brilliant with gambling. Always the opposite. We never win homes, we lose them. The only life changing outcome for gamblers is a shed load of problems -100% caused by gambling.

If they told the truth, which is more like....  lose ¬£10,000 to win ¬£105,  we would never ever accept those terms.   That is clearly a scam.   However, this is the financial ratio with gambling. 

Which makes it the worst investment scheme ever.  A ponzi scheme disguised as entertainment.

People have lost so much chasing tiny jackpots/wins. If that money had gone into a savings account, you'd be up more than you'd rake from gambling. You don't lose by saving.

Gambling companies block/limit anyone who does win. That's all you need to know.

Cut your losses or increase your losses. That's the truth."

606,1,"The Power of GoodbyeTo say goodbye forerver to a gambling addiction, realise we already say goodbye forever to other things.

Our last meal. Gone. Done. 

So we have existing examples of just accepting something is finished. 
Ourselves, aged 10, 15, 21.  We move on.

Christmas 2019. Gone. Finished.

Clothes, books, belongings we throw out. Once we're done, we can let go.
We let go of so much, so easily.

Think on that. Gambling needs to be put in the same bracket as scraps of paper we put in the bin. Find something you say goodbye to/dump easily and totally.  Start framing it that way.

Now you're done with gambling, what will you do with your cash and time? Rif with that."

610,1,"Time to quitI needed an outlet to pen down my journey. Hope it helps in my recovery.

I started online sports betting when i was 20 (28 now). Started off winning like most people here, thought i could beat the system and earn a couple of quick bucks. Many stressful and lifeless months later, probably lost about 10k, betting on soccer games played in countries i may not even have heard of. Finally i decided to call it quits and closed my account and stopped for about 6 years (of course with couple of fun bets here and there but always had it under control and did not escalate to full blown gambling).
Then came world cup 2018. Fun bets got out of control. Eventually i opened an online betting account and started the grind again. You know the story, started off winning and after many stressful and lifeless months later, lost about 6k (of which almost 2k was from the past month). I sometimes even bet during my work hours, which is definitely dangerous and scary.

Not in debt or anything and i have a comfortable income, getting married at the end of the year. But it is seriously damaging my mental well being. The reason i continue to bet is because i keep chasing my losses and i always think to myself that i will stop once i break even (which i dont think i ever will at this rate).

Bearing in mind i am a super frugal person, bashing myself up even when i saw something i bought at another shop going for 10 cents cheaper, not going on holiday trips because i feel that it is so costly and not worth it. Eating cheap meals because expensive meals are costly. I would consider myself to be a logical person, and prudent in my finances (well except gambling obviously). Yet, without blinking i am clicking hundreds per bet. 

So it‚Äôs time to stop."
611,1,"Day 1So much to write, so man day 1's.  I feel like i've gotten comfortable being broke, and I now allow myself to no longer be broke.  Yesterday was just insane, no need to go into the specifics, but I bought a stock, it immediately tanked, I panick sold it, and immediately once I sold it it more than doubled (stock ticker MYO for those that are interested to see the history).  I recently ran into a therapist that I saw for gambling when I was 17 or 18 (currently 37) at a wedding, and I felt such shame that I was dealing with this 20 years ago, and I'm still dealing with it.  So much damage done, both emotional and financial.  So much lying, not only to loved ones, but to myself.  I'm ready to break out of the disease.  I recently started with a therapist and he's been very helpful.  I'm ready to dedicate my time and money towards my family.  I'm ready to start paying off my debts.  I'm ready to be happy.  I'm ready to be at peace.  I'm ready to be calm.  I was blessed with lots of talents, the only thing that can really stop me is myself, and boy am I good at doing that.  I'm ready to get out of my own and start being the man I know I can be.  too much depression, too much debt, and worst of all, too much guilt.  I'm ready to let go of the past, although I'll be paying for it for a while, and start living for the present.

Need to intercept the chain reaction. As your brain is going to gambling as an outcome of loads of different thought/feeling scenarios,  you need to re-wire every possible thought/feeling/action sequence in your brain.

Spend as much time as possible to get that new sequence to gel. You need to find a new activity to fit into the sequence. If you feel sad, ideally you need to locate a new physical activity to represent it. Even a sad face emoji helps frame how you feel.

He confessed his addiction to me early in the relationship, I work in the mental health field and thought ""hey I have some concept of how to approach addiction and recovery"", but this is not the case when it's someone that you live with. 

He isn't in debt or takes out loans. It just seems that every time he gets paid (direct deposit, biweekly), he loses it all (~1300) within 48 hours doing sports bets. I've tried helping him by taking over finances, almost being his payee so his/our bills gets paid and giving him an allowance, but he got upset and said I was too controlling so I stopped so we wouldn't fight about it.

Well here we are again. He's saying he wants to sleep in his car and not come home as punishment to himself, saying he doesn't care about anything or anyone (he later admits he just says it cause he's mad at himself). I've tried asking him to seek professional help or attend a GA meeting, he's against it and stigmatizes those things a lot..

He said he will help me, and hopes that I can take this seriously and actually go through recovery.  I previously went through this with pills and alcohol, and I'm sure he's exhausted of this routine. But the reality is, although I'm off pills and booze, I never took recovery seriously - so my addiction to gambling just got out of control. I'm relieved on one hand that my husband now knows and he wants to be supportive, but I hated breaking his heart. In his mind, we were close to buying a home and really starting our future. Now I've set us back big time. I hope I can show him through my actions that I really do want a better future for us.

622,1,"Ego - Part 2:Lack of Self-EsteemMy name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. So having tackled the definition I want to dive into the traits of egotism and see how these have played a role in my life so far, but mainly I will be focusing on the role they played during my addiction. There are a lot of traits out there on the internet when it comes to egotism so I am going to focus on the following (all taken from powerofpositivity.com):

*Lack of self-esteem - Ironic as it may sound, most egotists do not have a very positive self-image. They acutely recognise their insecurities and attempt to camouflage these insecurities by forcing a false persona ‚Äì one of competence and confidence ‚Äì in a desperate attempt to conceal their real state of mind.*

*Megalomaniacal thought patterns - Having high expectations of oneself is a healthy and productive frame of mind. However, spending a lot of time thinking about how one‚Äôs greatness will far exceed anything conceivably realistic is not healthy or fruitful.*

*Penchant for exaggeration and dramatization - As mentioned, egotists have an insatiable desire to make themselves appear important to impress others. As such, they‚Äôll often exaggerate and dramatically overstate various aspects of their life. If an egotist perceives their life‚Äôs progress as inadequate ‚Äì a common characteristic of such people ‚Äì they‚Äôll embellish anything and everything in order to make up for this ‚Äúgap‚Äù. Should someone call them out, they‚Äôll frequently overreact in a desperate attempt to get people to buy whatever they are selling.*

*Needing the limelight - Part of an egotist‚Äôs ravenous need for validation is apparent in their conversations with others. When the topic of conversation does not involve them, an egotist cannot help but intercede in a desperate attempt to redirect the spotlight. This is such childish behaviour to the highest degree, but an egotist doesn‚Äôt perceive it this way. A conversation that doesn‚Äôt revolve around them is not worth having or participating in.*

*Needing to feel an exaggerated sense of control - Unsurprisingly, many egotists believe that their way is the best way ‚Äì and the only way. If an egotist detects a loss of control ‚Äì often perceived as an act of disrespect ‚Äì they‚Äôre quick to become angry and defensive. Such attitudes and behaviours are most apparent in a group setting. Many workplaces appreciate and understand the importance of teamwork in accomplishing a common task or goal. However, the notion that ‚Äútwo heads are better than one‚Äù is distant and imperceptible for those with an egotistical streak.*

**Lack of self-esteem**

*What is self-esteem? (Taken from mind.org.uk)*

*Self-esteem is how we value and perceive ourselves. It‚Äôs based on our opinions and beliefs about ourselves, which can sometimes feel really difficult to change.*

*Your self-esteem can affect whether you:*

*Like and value yourself as a person*

*Are able to make decisions and assert yourself*

*Recognise your strengths and positives*

*Feel able to try new or difficult things*

*Show kindness towards yourself*

*Move past mistakes without blaming yourself unfairly*

*Believe you matter and are good enough*

*Believe you deserve happiness*

Looking back I feel I have suffered from a lack of self-esteem for many years. In my teenage years I was never really happy with how I looked, felt I was overweight, ugly, did not have any girlfriends. It played on my mind a bit but I tended to try and just bury it deep inside and go out with my friends and have a good time. What I did have, in abundance, was wit and charm and I quickly learnt how to be funny and become the life and soul of the party. I built that party persona and people liked me, I was fun to be around and I will be honest here, I liked that persona as well. I enjoyed the attention and people laughing at my jokes (which we will touch on later) and it made me forget my lack of success with the opposite sex. I was not great at communicating with girls, even my persona tended to freeze up when it came to talking to them. If I got to know them, say a friend‚Äôs girlfriend or a female work colleague, I could talk away to them and make jokes and they liked me, well at least I think they did. Liked me as a friend of course, but I felt like once I got to know a girl I could talk to her, I just could not pull the trigger when I was out and about in pubs or clubs‚Ä¶probably did not help that I had quite a few beers in me on those occasions.

In school I had my core group of friends but I also got along well with nearly everyone no matter what clique they fell into. Again, looking back, I wonder did I do this intentionally, did I develop an ability to be able to converse about almost anything, be it sports, video games, music etc.? That ability allowed me to drift between groups during school and avoid any sort of bullying or torture that some people endure during their school life. I tried to make friends with pretty much every group more so as a defense mechanism for me so I did not have to deal with any confrontation in school, I just blended in no matter who I was with.

So when it comes to gambling and my addiction where does a lack of self-esteem fit in? Well for one I carried on that trait of getting along well with nearly everyone into my adult life, I probably still do that to this day as I do not like confrontation or awkward silences. My laughing, joking persona has become who I am as well, between self deprecating jokes or jokes that push the boundaries (it‚Äôs no coincidence I am called ‚ÄúThe Dark Tourist‚Äù in work due to conversations when I am around), I still have that persona, to be honest, that is probably who I am now. Although I do feel that I am getting better at knowing the right time to have a laugh and a joke and the right time to be serious.

Back to when I was gambling though, according to mind.org.uk problems with money and ongoing stress can cause low self-esteem. So it is no surprise given how every month I would be faced with money problems due to gambling and I would spend large portions of the month once my money ran out trying to figure out how I was going to survive until the next payday. When I say survive, I do not mean food wise, I mean survive that no one finds out about my gambling problem, Add to that the amount of debt I had gotten myself into and how stressed I could become about my financial situation when I spent time thinking about it or stressing over my partner finding out and losing her and the kids.

Finally, I just want to take the list of eight things your self-esteem can affect from above and describe how I felt during my active addiction.

**Like and value yourself as a person**

When I ran out of money for gambling and was trying to figure out how to survive the month I pretty much hated myself and thought I was worthless. Those thoughts were not as active when I was in the middle of gambling as I was almost like a zombie, physically and mentally. If anything, when winning at least, I thought I was amazing and if people only knew how good I was at gambling they would envy me.

**Are able to make decisions and assert yourself**

I was never able to make decisions around my gambling and how to stop or how to ""control"" what I was spending. I would tell myself I would only gambling for one hour then be sitting there four hours later. When it came to decisions outside of gambling I was afraid to make any that may have exposed my gambling problem and did not want to assert myself in case someone questioned me and my motives.

**Recognise your strengths and positives**

I have been crap at this my whole life and the perfect example is when it comes to job interviews. I am terrible at getting across what experiences I have or how to make what I do sound important, I just do my job, I am a boring person, I have no strengths and no positives. Even in recovery, it has been a struggle to recognise how far I have come and accepting any praise or positives has been difficult.

**Feel able to try new or difficult things**

By the time I entered recovery the only hobby I had left was gambling, it was the only thing I did and the only thing I had any interest in doing. Going out and trying new things would have just gotten in the way of me gambling and I had no desire to be out either. I think I was also scared of leaving myself open to the possibility of failure. In my mind if I didn‚Äôt try something I couldn‚Äôt fail at it.

**Show kindness towards yourself**

The addiction tricked me into thinking that gambling was a way of rewarding myself and a way to relax and unwind but when I had lost all my money and was scrambling to figure out how to survive the month I would hate myself for what I had done. Then I would make it to payday and my reward for that would be to gamble again and the sick, twisted cycle just kept repeating.

**Move past mistakes without blaming yourself unfairly**

Finally one that was not really affected during my active addiction as I had the ability to blame everybody else for anything that went wrong and not myself. If I made any mistakes I just made sure they would not expose my gambling problem and moved forward without thinking about any potential damage or hurt I had caused. I also felt that I would be able to fix the mistakes I had made, via gambling, and all would be well again.

**Believe you matter and are good enough**

The persona I had and the vibe I would give off to people was that I was confident, funny and thought I was more than good enough but inside my own head I thought I was a piece of shit most of the time. To clarify, I thought I was a piece of shit when I was out of money and waiting for the next payday but once I got paid again those thoughts disappeared until the money ran out. Again, that sick, twisted cycle on repeat.

**Believe you deserve happiness**

More than deserved happiness, during my active addiction I felt I was entitled to happiness and I should have it handed to me on a plate. I had no idea what actually made me happy but looking back I think money was what I thought would solve it. Not a massive win but it got to the point where the only way to get my finances back on track was to gamble my way out steadily and of course that only escalates and ends in disaster. Money and being liked by those around me because I think deep down I thought if they knew the real me they would not stick around. I just believed that gambling, at some point, would give me the happiness I was craving.

623,1,Day 2. Interesting revelation.Feeling a lot better than I did yesterday. Trips me out though when I think about how frugal I am with small everyday expenses but I‚Äôll go gamble with a couple thousand multiple days in a row like it‚Äôs nothing. Gambling will literally turn you into a different person and I just can‚Äôt wait until I have a few bet-free years under my belt. Life really does become better every time I stop. This time it‚Äôs for good and I‚Äôm really looking forward to moving forward. Best wishes to everybody in this community. We‚Äôre in this together!

626,1,"i want to stop gamblingHello. i am a student i have no income, but i have recently won $2500 from a darts competition. With so much money on me and not sure what to spend on, i decided to gamble blackjack in online casino just for fun.. i started with a $100 top up, i only bet $5 a time, occasionally betting few hands of $5, but when i lose, i will lose control and doing big bets like $20 on 3 to 5 hands in hopes of winning + covering my loses. By doing this.. i have lost over $2000 even after telling myself to stop. every time i lose the $100 top up , i would buy in another $100 and make a $100 bet in hopes of covering my loses.. but everytime i would lose. and now i'm left with a pitiful $50 where i could've celebrated with that $2500. Im a person that think very long on every cent that i spend, i'm would even think for a long time even if it was just buying a $10 shirt. Yet here i am, so easily gambling thousands away.."
627,1,"Am I Nuts, Or Is He Gambling? Desperately Seeking AdviceMy spouse and I have been married 4 years. I'm early 50's, he's 66, both second marriages. He is retired with a pension from a good job, but both before and after retirement and ever since I've known him, he lives from paycheck to paycheck, for reasons that remain shrouded in mystery.  No matter how much money my spouse brings in during a given month, never less than 5k, he is always out of money before the week is out. The only bill he is directly responsible for is his cell phone. There was a period of time I'd come across stacks of Lotto tickets shoved in drawers. And he often spends hours playing some kind of card game on his computer. I've now gotten him to hand over about 35% of his income (pension and gig income) to me the day it appears in his account, and that is his contribution to the bills. I make a decent living freelancing myself, and sock a little away each month, but grow increasingly alarmed at his chronically being broke. For the last 6 months he appears to be blowing through about 5k a month, always ""running out"" of money within a week of it hitting his account. I'm 99.9% sure he's not having an affair, and 99.95 sure he's not secretly drinking. He is very private and defensive about money, and offers circular logic whenever I tried to discuss it in the past. The behavior is so consistent over multiple years that the only reasonable conclusion I can come to (compounded by the stacks of lottery tickets and the online card game) is that he is gambling, which consistently wipes him out. Am I right? If I am, what can I do, beyond taking steps to insulate my own property and income and take charge of the bills, which I have done? Thoughts and advice would be hugely appreciated."

629,1,"Who needs to know?I've read a lot about the importance of being honest and coming clean to family and friends. I plan on telling my husband about my gambling addiction and debt but, beyond that, do I need to tell my parents - who live out of state and I've never so much as borrowed money from? Friends who live out of state? I just know there is so much stigma around this and lack of understanding. I'm not sure anyone would benefit from knowing something that never impacted them."

633,1,"Big step tonight! I told my husband and I‚Äôm feeling üëçüèΩHi everyone!  I‚Äôm a compulsive online gambler and I think I‚Äôm ready to tell you my story. I‚Äôve been here a few months now and want to thank everyone for sharing their stories, words of encouragement, posting their clean days and your suggestions on steps for recovery. A special shout out to Jamie from the After Gambling podcast. It led me to this amazingly supportive community and also to Allen Carr‚Äôs book, The Easy Way to Stop Gambling. These tools and you all, have all helped me out of the darkest of places. Thank you for that. 

I had previously  been a social gambler. Casinos maybe once or twice a month with an amount I was comfortable losing if I lost. Have seen friends lose so much money and thought they were crazy. Telling me they‚Äôve gambled their whole paycheck. I‚Äôve seen a friend win a jackpot that could buy a small house all to be in foreclosure 2 years later chasing another win like  that. I thought they were crazy. They need help!  

Flip the switch to 2016 and I discovered my personal demon - online gambling. Now I‚Äôm the one in trouble. Of course I had a huge win when I started and couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it was and I didn‚Äôt even have to leave my house and drive to a casino. A year later 2017, I‚Äôm hiding my gambling and racked up a ton of cc debt. Chasing losses. Now all the Tax forms are coming in and have to come clean. I came clean to my husband and took out a personal loan to pay off all my debt and thought I was on a good path. 5 years and I would be free of debt. But I wasn‚Äôt. I DIDNT DO ANYTHING to change my gambling habit. I lowered my deposit limit and would play once a month. I didn‚Äôt seek out help. I just turned the losing money faucet to a slow trickle. My husband and I didn‚Äôt talk anymore about the gambling. Big mistake. He trusted me that I would just stop. We should‚Äôve kept talking about it. 

In 2019 I guess I had another significant win from my one gambling site. And of course, I lost it all. I had only stuck to one site and when I lost my winnings, I got angry and got crazy. I ended up creating accounts on several gaming sites. I went off the deep end. I racked up more debt and took out another personal loan. Sometimes I spent all night gambling. At one point as I‚Äôm gambling and laying on the couch, my Apple Watch starts signaling me that my heart rate is dangerously high and that I needed to rest!  I was laying down for hours. No physical activity except my fingers pounding on the phone. But I kept on playing, even though I could feel my heart racing. Like what is wrong with me that I might have a heart attack or something and here I am still playing. And that‚Äôs one of the moments I realized that I needed help. How could I have let this happen again?!  How can I tell my husband I did this again!  I felt there was no way out and no hope. My husband is a good man. We have a loving and wonderful marriage. How could I fall into this addiction. I have a good job, good friends and family. Why? Why am I doing this? 

I started googling and found the After Gambling podcast, this forum, different Audible books, it‚Äôs been a few months and the road has not been easy. The road was very dark. Jamie‚Äôs voice was my first life saver. A voice to make me feel like I wasn‚Äôt alone. I started to see some light. And because of you here, you have helped me see more light. It has helped me to read your stories and not feel alone. It has helped me when I can help others here. So many of your thoughts on recovery have stuck in my head. These are all my weapons against this addiction. 

Sorry this is so long. But I am really proud of myself. Tonight I came clean for the 2nd time. It was tough. To disappoint my husband again is beyond heartbreaking. After all the love he has given me for 20 years. I had put off telling him the 2nd time for so long. But this time, I had already started recovering.   I feel like my brain is rewiring itself. I told him I had a problem again. I told him that I know cannot ever be a casual gambler anymore. I told him I took out another loan. I told him about all the things I‚Äôm doing to help myself. And it was hard!  I told him about the dark thoughts I used to have. It was a crappy tough hard conversation. Yes, he was mad, but he loves me and we are going to work on it together. Next steps are GA, and a counsellor.  We also listened to the After Gambling podcast episode that was made to help tell your family. I also asked him to listen to the other episodes. We are going to do this together. I‚Äôm really proud of myself. I‚Äôm happy he still loves me. Although, I have lost his trust, we are going to work on this together to rebuild it and to help me battle this.   I‚Äôm in a good place tonight. One day at a time. I also want to add, feel free to DM me if you feel like it. I know at first I felt conscientious being here as a female. But tonight I feel a little braver and an immense weight lifted off me. I‚Äôm going to keep moving forward. And I wish you all well. If you‚Äôve made it this far, Thank you for reading my story."

637,1,"Day 1. Super bowl nightmaresDay 1. 3rd bad beat on a Super Bowl. Can‚Äôt do this anymore. Had a wild 6-year run all starting from a $1000 bet on the broncos to win the Super Bowl in 2014..... they got blown out big time. Should have taken that as a sign (and I would have) but I never could have imagined in my wildest dreams it‚Äôd get to this point. Just wanted that $1000 back and ended up chasing loss after loss with bigger amounts and parlays. So many bad beats but two stick in my head like no other.... had a crazy amount on the Seahawks to win the Super Bowl when they threw the interception on the 1-yrd line  instead of giving it to Lynch to run it a yard for a TD. What a gutwrencher, literally labeled one of the worst bad beats of all time. Hurt bad. Fast forward a few years and an OBSCENE amount of money I had lost - this year I had the 49ers  +4.5 so I thought it‚Äôd be easy money on a sure close game (even though I had to take -200 odds). Up by 10 with 7min left and I‚Äôm feeling great. 14 unanswered by the chiefs and they‚Äôre up by 4 and I‚Äôm sweating. Less than 2min left so I figure I‚Äôll be alright.... until the the 9ers go 3 and out and let the chiefs slip by right away for a long TD run out of nowhere. Chiefs up by 11, can‚Äôt even believe it. Had just lost thousands right before my birthday a week ago and had put up just enough money to win it all back on the Super Bowl as a desperate attempt to get my money back and quit forever and then I take another BRUTAL loss. Worked so hard for all this just to lose it just like that. Going to take months and months of hard work to even begin to get a chunk of that back and man do I feel like trash. Had stopped for almost 4 months and then I lose a crazy amount of money in less than 2 weeks. It gets out of control so fast and I‚Äôm so done with thinking about gambling 24/7 and being depressed. I‚Äôve lost almost all motivation to work and feel like I don‚Äôt care about my money anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this feeling on anyone and I‚Äôm ready for this to be the last time I feel like this. I‚Äôm back living at home and want to tell my mom/stepdad so bad but don‚Äôt want them to worry or be disappointed. I‚Äôm so stressed out but too embarrassed to come clean. I‚Äôve had such a good opportunity to save money while living here and I feel like it‚Äôs such a slap in the face to them that I can‚Äôt even bring myself to tell/admit the truth. At the same time, I literally want to hand over my ID and life savings to them to prevent me from even thinking about doing anything dumb again. I luckily have my girlfriend for that but it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same.  Its really hard when barely anybody knows what you‚Äôre going through. This hiding and feeling sorry for myself have led me to drinking again, another one of my big problems/addictions. I feel like 6 years have went by and I‚Äôm in a worse spot in life. What a waste of time and effort in the ‚Äúbest‚Äù years of my life. I‚Äôm still young (27) and today have come to that I can live with the fact that I ruined 6 years of my life at this point. As long as I stop now I‚Äôm going to be completely fine - that‚Äôs what I keep telling myself at least. Gambling addiction is real and is no joke at all. It‚Äôs easy to hide at first and will just start eating you up inside like no other. I needed to vent but if my story can prevent one person from losing money than it was all worth it. Please don‚Äôt do like I did and waste years of your life. It‚Äôs not worth the stress and I‚Äôll let you know now that the house ALWAYS wins. Period. Let that sink in now and you‚Äôll be much better off. You can‚Äôt beat a game where the odds are stacked against you, it‚Äôs just that simple."
638,1,Day 5Ô∏è‚É£Back on track!  Let‚Äôs do this!
639,1,"Broke but richI‚Äôm trying to get on top of my debts and the last two paydays have been spent paying towards them, I‚Äôve had hardly anything left but enough to put food in the cupboards until the next payday and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve never been so broke but feel so rich. 
When payday came I‚Äôd pick which bills I was going to pay and which ones I wasn‚Äôt so that I had money left over for bingo and slots. Even when I went food shopping I would make sacrifices so that I could hold on to as much gambling money as possible, then that would be gone over the course of a few nights and I‚Äôd be borrowing again. 
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that I haven‚Äôt got a lot of money right now but I‚Äôm spending it correctly and it‚Äôs an amazing feeling to actually see how far a little goes when you aren‚Äôt throwing it in machines. I always felt broke and desperate even though I had a hell of a lot more money than I have right now. 
I‚Äôve managed to get one big debt out of the way in 2 months and hope to be debt free by July. 
I always felt badly done to, moaning how I cant get on top of my money, I was bitter about people having nice things, thought the world was against me, miserable little gambler.. boo hoo poor me. Well I look back and I don‚Äôt feel sorry for myself one bit, I thought the world owed me a big win and was angry when I didn‚Äôt get it but that person on the other side of the room did. I remember going to the toilet in the club and literally ripping at my hair in anger and defeat, I was angry at myself for being stupid but more angry at the club for not giving me a win, me who had spent so much and surely I deserved the biggest win of the night.
Crazy times.. that big win I could have gotten wouldn‚Äôt have changed my life, it would have meant that I could go back to the club the next night and be really flamboyant with my money and wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about how much I shoved in the machines. That would have been total bliss to me, but now that makes me feel sick.

Just needed a ramble. I‚Äôm so broke but oh so rich right now üòä keep up the good work everyone, no matter what day you are on, or if you are still trying to stop, it will get better xx"
640,1,"Coming clean to husbandNew to the group here. I‚Äôve been running up substantial gambling debt for the past 4 years or so. It‚Äôs so so out of control. Maxed out many credit cards, drained my savings. Thankfully I have income but am really at the point where I don‚Äôt want to keep wasting away my paycheck and more importantly my life. I married my boyfriend of ten years in October and he doesn‚Äôt know anything, other than past alcohol and pill issues. Now pregnant with our first baby (10 weeks) and I am planning on coming clean about everything and taking real steps to change. Thankfully I haven‚Äôt compromised any of his money, no joint accounts yet etc. But this severely impacts our future - as we want to buy a home etc. I want to lay out a plan for tackling my debt, tell him everything and am hoping he gives me another chance. I feel like because of my previous substance abuse issues he is going to to just be exhausted of me. I know he loves me so much, I‚Äôm just terrified of losing him. All I want now is to get well for myself and for our family. I‚Äôm meeting with a therapist tomorrow who specializes in addiction - I‚Äôm hoping she can help me lay out a plan for telling him, and then I just need to find a time when neither of us are working.  I guess I‚Äôm just hoping for some words of encouragement here."

644,1,"Day 40: A Close CallYesterday, in the hours leading up to the super bowl I was scrambling to try and place a bet on the game. Previously, I had put a number of barriers between me and being able to bet online or with the only in-person bookie I know. Those barriers included self exclusion online, web blockers for which I don‚Äôt have the password, blocking international transactions on all my credit/debit cards, and telling my friends to never assist me in placing a bet. Due to those restrictions I was literally unable to place a bet despite my best efforts.

I wake up today clear eyed and extremely happy that I‚Äôm able to hit day 40. Yesterday might be the clearest evidence yet for me that compulsive gambling is truly a disease. I was solely focused on being able to place a bet on the game. Even though I would‚Äôve won in the short term (was eyeing a bet on Chiefs spread) I know that inevitably would have reopened the floodgates.

Moral of the story: put as many barriers as you physically can between you and gambling. Your future self will thank you."

Talk about a quick spiral. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I also remember telling one of my friends about it, like all excited that I had found this amazing site to gamble for real money without leaving home. She just looked at me super confused and asked me why I was gambling at all. I remember feeling embarrassed and defensive by her reaction but then brushing the whole thing off as her ‚Äúnot getting it.‚Äù Quitting online gambling was a lot easier than brick and mortar casino gambling though. A quick email and it‚Äôs pretty much done. If that would‚Äôve been the case for the casino, I would‚Äôve excluded years ago and have saved tens of thousands. So many regrets and so much to reflect back on but I look forward to Day 46 tomorrow because I‚Äôve made it through Day 45 without placing a bet."

661,1,"Day 1 AgainHi All
Day 1 again.
I‚Äôm committed to stopping but it‚Äôs harder than I thought.
For so long I‚Äôd stopped all online bettings apps but another has opened and I‚Äôve opened a account and in the space of this weekend lost ¬£600.
It just shows that I can‚Äôt control it and will always chase loses.
It‚Äôs closed now and app deleted so will start again."
662,1,"10 MonthsMy name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. So today is 10 months since my last bet, which was on some terrible tennis match on a Tuesday morning. The exact date and time when the bet was settled a loser was April 2nd 2019 at 08:52. It is fitting that I bowed out of my gambling a career as a loser (like most of us I am sure) as that is how gambling had made me feel up to that point. Inside I felt like a loser, a waster, I felt pathetic and the worst thing was, I was scared that by giving up gambling I would feel even worse. Even after how I was feeling I was still clinging on to gambling like it was some sort of life raft when in reality it was the concrete shoes dragging me deeper and deeper towards the bottom.

So, as I have written about before, I told those closest to me and entered recovery and it has been the best thing I have ever done. I was lucky, my ""Pink Cloud"" lasted for about 6 months, life was great and everything was straight forward. Then the shit hit the fan with my partner having a cancer scare and my Daughter being admitted to hospital for pneumonia in a short space of time. The thing was I was prepared to deal with this the right way because of what I have learned in recovery up until this point, because I had a support network around me that I could lean on and because I was more in touch with my feelings. Why am I saying this? I don't like to offer advice, merely suggestions, but if I could offer one suggestion it would be this; If things are going well in your recovery in the early days then make hay while the sun shines. Listen and learn, participate, build up your strength and add tools to your toolkit, because at some point life is going to ask you to make chicken salad out of chicken shit. Conversely, if they are not going well, keep on grinding because that will strengthen you in the future when life finally eases up a little.

There is so much knowledge and wisdom out there, either via Reddit, a G.A. Room, via Skype, via WhatsApp, a SMART Recovery meeting, talking to other compulsive gamblers on Twitter, blogs, vlogs, podcasts and more. More than that...there is hope.

I'll leave you with this...

*How do we accept ourselves after what we did in active addiction?*

*Can I face my reflection and truly love the person I'm looking at?*

*Loving ourselves takes time and it won't happen overnight.*

*Just For Today I will try and love myself for who I am.*

663,1,"Find Something BeautifulHad some shit blow up in my personal life last night, so I didn‚Äôt sleep much. Got out of the house early this morning, just driving around and listening to music, trying to clear my mind. Old thoughts crept up like long-lost friends. In the past, this is where I‚Äôd meander towards the casino and just absolutely lay waste to my checking account or credit card. I entertained the thought long enough this morning to imagine what would happen if I went to the casino. Most likely, I‚Äôd lose a considerable amount of money. And if I did happen to win, then my days would reset to zero and I‚Äôd find it much easier to go back, eventually losing anything won and much, much more. Instead, I made my way to the beach and sat out on a pavilion for a while, enjoying the view and the breeze. It doesn‚Äôt give me the high that slot machines did, but it actually nourishes me and I know throughout the day, I‚Äôm going to feel better, calmer, and move forward towards my goals instead of backwards because of this decision. Casinos brought me hours of excitement and years of misery. Best of luck to everyone fighting the battle. Day by day."
664,1,Get THIS stuck in to your head: THERE IS NO HAPPY ENDING IN GAMBLINGThis ain‚Äôt no movie. This is real life lol.
665,1,Day 35Tough going. Losses still in my head. First few weeks were like slow motion like nothing happened. Now the bigger picture unfolds with destruction caused by last relapse. Stay strong everyone.

671,1,"""Clean time"" is not the same as recovery. Clean time requires only willpower. Recovery also requires introspection, dealing with feelings and having courage and faith to leave behind a life that worked (even though it was destructive, it was a survival mechanism). Do not confuse these two."
672,1,"Day 43 and seeing clearlyFor no real reason that I can think of, today, I finally know in my heart and in my mind and with every ounce of my being that I will NEVER get life-changing rich from playing slots. This was the single thought which drove me over the edge when I was compulsively gambling. I was absolutely convinced that I would win hundreds of thousands, possibly millions from playing slots and that my entire life would magically change and all my dreams would come true. This is the lie that gambling tells. This lie is at the core of the evil that is the gambling trap. And today, as I was reading through a few posts from earlier today in which many wrote about how they relapsed or ended up chasing losses, it dawned on me that it‚Äôs never going to happen. Not for them, not for me, not reasonably for anyone because the odds are so tiny; it‚Äôs downright impossible. I finally get it. I hope this post helps others get it too."
673,1,Day 54
674,1,"Lost way too much, need some encouragement :(I'm just a loser. In all aspects of life now a days. 31 years old, business has been struggling. In my 20's I was the envy of all my friends. Even though I lost about 120k sports betting in the first 5 years of that decade I was making good money and it didn't really phase me. I had girls, money, lots of friends now I got the latter but zero money. Thinking about selling my house. How life can change so quickly. 21 years old I made almost 150k. 31 I made 25k. Lost 48k gambling! Slots mainly. Thinking I could get my life back on track with a lucky spin. Obviously that didn't happen. Mind you, I lost all that in 6 months. 48k down in 6 months, wtf is wrong with me. No one knows. Not my girlfriend, she'd leave me 100% if she knew. It's against her religion and values to gamble. My mom has stage 4, definitely don't want to add stress to her life. Just struggling here but I tell myself that only I can change my finances and it's something 100% in my control, whether I get part time work or hope business is better this year. I increased marketing, let go of some employees but got a 50k business loan that I maxed out last year trying to keep business afloat. I think that's what got me back into gambling after quitting in 2015. Oh well. 

I got 8k in credit card due to gambling. 50k business loan. And another 50k line of credit that I maxed out starting a new online furniture business  that I will be maxing out once I have the website, marketing. Already have enough inventory to clear all debts, just praying that it works out.

Anyway. Almost 110k in debt. Made 20k last year lol. Will have two businesses come April 1st and that will be my focus. I'm not worried about gambling anymore. It lost its magic for good. I hate stressing over money and have enough risk and gambling to do with my two businesses. (got to be smart about these risks)

Just venting I guess. Hate the fact that I lost so much in such a short period of time. Makes me sick and my girlfriend keeps asking why I seem so distant. I tell her it's work stress which is only half the truth. Lying to her kills me, she's such a sweetheart. 

I look at life sometimes and be like what's the point in working and stressing over money and bills? My dad died when he wasn't even 50 due to mental health reasons. My mom retired and in the same year at 60 yrs old gets diagnosed with stage 4. One of my uncles whom I was very close with died at 63 to cancer. These were healthy people with no vices, farmers, eating local produce. Then I look at Kobe last weekend. Anything can happen, one day you're here, the next day you're gone.

Sorry if all this seems depressing. Maybe will go back to therapy. I'm not suicidal, just wondering what life's all about. It's not money I know that. Sometimes I think of selling everything I have, leaving my girlfriend and taking the 50k+- I have in equity after clearing my debts and just moving somewhere warm and chill and just work minimally to pay the bills and enjoy life. But then I'm not like that, like all gamblers have some sort of ambition to be taking such heavy risks with their money. I'm all over the place mentally. I don't drink, do drugs but I am addicted to making money. I need to find fulfillment elsewhere. But for now, at 31, I will dedicate the next 10 years of my life to the hustle. Stay positive, faith, work hard and hopefully everything will work. 

Till then, don't gamble. It's shitty, losing money is shitty. The mood it puts you in after losing is shitty. Even while gambling its shitty to me now. No more. When I get that gambling urge I will just go to my shop and work on my businesses. Maybe that's more productive gambling. I'll stick to my goals and revisit this conversation in my head at 40 years old. 

Sorry for the rant, just finding it difficult to get over the fact I blew twice my last year salary in 6 months.

Be strong brothers and sisters."
675,1,"Be careful out thereI was 14 days clean and then had a ‚Äúone bet‚Äù moment. That lost. $250 down drain. Then a $1.33 last leg of multi would have put me up $100 after the two bets. That lost. Then I chased on lakers live bet. That lost. Then I chased on tennis. That lost. It only starts with one bet. I was going to stop after the initial win to get money for my trip, or stop if the second one cleared my first bet with small profit on side. It never works out. Just avoid it."
676,1,"I‚Äôm 20 years old and have lost over 50,000$ in gambling.I need to quit. I have a good job and make decent money. But I spend everything I get on gambling.

Tonight I went to the casino and lost 1000 $ in about 25 mins. I need to stop but I wake up everyday wanting to go back. Today was different tho after leaving I just felt so disgusted and mad. I didn‚Äôt even enjoy it I wanna stop. My wife knows I go to the casino but doesn‚Äôt know Howmuch I lose. I have a daughter on the way and wanna give her a good life. I‚Äôm scared that if I keep going to the casino
I‚Äôm gonna blow all my savings I guess this is gonna be the start of day one. No more gambling."

686,1,"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.Why do I find myself doing the same things over and over again? Gambling, losing money, repeat. It‚Äôs not exactly that I think something will be different next time or that I will win it‚Äôs just like it‚Äôs habit or I just can‚Äôt help myself. Why is gambling the only thing in my life that brings some joy (sometimes) and the only thing that seems to keep me occupied during the days? Why can‚Äôt I find something else to do that won‚Äôt hurt me financially but still get that same feeling and not being bored."
687,1,"Ego - Part One:The DefinitionMy name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. Since being in recovery and working the steps one character defect I keep seeing raise its ugly head is my ego. I have decided to do a bit of research on egotism and trying to see how it fits together with my actions in addiction. I say research, I have been Googling it but what more do you expect folks! 

Per Cambridge dictionary the definition of egotism is *‚Äúthinking only about yourself and considering yourself better and more important than other people.‚Äù* Now there is a lot more to it than that but first I am going to concentrate on the two things mentioned in this definition and see how they link into me during my addiction and were they apparent in my behaviour before my addiction.

**Thinking only about yourself**

Quick background on me, I have a partner, two children aged seven and three, my Mum and my Dad, no siblings and other family members and friends. I now realise, in recovery, how much of a support network I do actually have and how many people care about me. Sadly, when I was gambling, I did not give a fuck about anyone and all I cared about was me and gambling. I loved my family and friends when I was gambling, deep down that love was there, but when I was gambling they did not enter my thoughts. 

When it came to the money I was gambling I never thought about what I could have bought my kids with that money or how I could have taken my partner out for a meal to show her how much I appreciate her staying at home with the kids while I go off to work. No. That money was MY money and no one was going to get their hands on it apart from a bookmaker. 

Simple things like making conversation did not enter my mind when I was gambling. I did not think to look up from my phone or laptop to ask how my partner was doing in the evenings, I pretty much sat and ignored her. If she tried to speak to me I would answer back with as few words as possible and if she kept talking I would get agitated. Generally I would end up causing an argument just to get her to be quiet. I barely spoke to my Mum and Dad when I was at their house or they were at mine, generally I was picking up my kids who they had taken for the day to help me out. They had given up their day for me and I couldn‚Äôt give up 15 minutes of my time to make conversation.

I had little interest in going out and doing things with anyone as it would get in the way of what I wanted to do. Perfect example of this was the final weekend before I entered recovery. My partner and I were invited to my Aunt and Uncle‚Äôs anniversary dinner (I cannot even remember the year they were celebrating, that is how much I was paying attention) without our kids, a night out together where we could unwind and enjoy ourselves. I spent the whole night gambling away on my mobile phone on in-play tennis and barely spoke a word to anyone. I did not care and I did not want to be there as it was getting in the way of me trying to dig myself out of a hole that I had dug for myself. I was in such a bad way financially I didn‚Äôt even bring my wallet with me as I had no money in my accounts. I had to lie to my Dad about why I didn‚Äôt bring it and he ended up buying me and my partner drinks for the night. I was even gambling on the drive down (I was driving!) with one eye on my phone and one eye on the road. I was in a desperate situation and could feel the walls closing in but I was confident I could win my way out.

When I think back to the number of times I told my kids to be quiet and play or shouted at them when they would ask me questions when I was focusing on gambling really does fill me with a great sense of sadness. I did not think about how they would feel when I acted that way, all I cared about was me. I can remember them pretty much climbing over me, wanting my attention while I just maneuvered around them so I could see what was happening on my phone or laptop. What makes it worse is that they think I am the greatest person that ever lived and love me so much, reflecting back on my behaviour during those days is tough but I feel it is necessary for me to do so as I do not want to go back there. 

I had a fantastic upbringing and I am so grateful for how my parents raised me and how they provided for me. Growing up I was an only child so everything to an extent has always been about me in my family. People think that only children are spoiled and I have no shame in admitting that I was extremely spoiled, not to a degree where it was damaging as my parents always made sure I appreciated the things I had and to always be thankful. I never had to learn to share with a brother or sister so when I was at home my toys were mine and I did not have to think about anyone else. Maybe that is where I planted the seed that I only need to think about myself and maybe that is why I enjoyed my own company so much because everything when I was on my own was about me and that is how I liked it.

**Considering yourself better and more important than other people**

This is a hard one for me to get a handle on simply because I do not feel that I came across this way when I was interacting with people, well at least I hope I did not. What I can be sure of is that in my own head I totally believed I was better and more important than other people.

I felt like my opinion mattered more than other peoples opinion and if I was discussing something, lets use football as an example, I would totally shit all over a different opinion to mine, but I would do this in my own head, by talking to myself. I would laugh at how wrong people were when they gave their opinion, again, in my own head. One thing I would do during a discussion is to continue talking about my opinion until either the persons involved agreed or until I rationalised it in my own mind that they knew I was right. 

Without sounding like a lunatic I have an internal monologue going on in my head all the time, even in recovery. I talk to myself quite a lot and would almost have conversations with myself about everything and anything. My brain feels as if it is always active. When I was in active addiction my internal monologue was extremely negative and dark. I tried to keep it buried deep inside me as I was a horrible person who thought he was the best at everything and back then I knew if that person came out in public it would be make it hard for me to keep my addiction secret. I was aware that I needed to keep people onside so they could help fund what I was doing.

I would rarely listen to advice from anyone because in my mind if I did not already know something then clearly it was not worth knowing. My Dad found out about me spread betting when I was still living at home and told me about the dangers of gambling and how easy it was to become addicted. I just brushed it off because I thought I knew better. I at least knew I didn‚Äôt have a problem. I did not want someone telling me I was wrong about something because how dare they correct me about anything! Everything I said was right and nothing would change my mind about it. I enjoyed reminding people when I was right about something as well, the smug look on my face, I took so much joy from that, it reinforced to me that I was better than everyone. I would constantly bring things up that I was right about and when someone tried to do the same I would pick holes in it and call them out for talking rubbish. 

If I was in a group or going out I felt the need to be in control of the situation, I wanted to be the leader because no one else could lead as well as I could, no one else was my equal and in my mind I wanted people to see how great I was, as a leader I was in the spotlight. Being in control of the situation also meant I could decide what we did and make sure it was something that I enjoyed doing. 

Emotionally, I was empty during my addiction; I did not care for how other people were feeling or what problems they had. If someone was telling me a problem I would listen but I would not care, in my head I was just asking myself why? Why are you telling me this? Why do you think I care what is going on in your life? Why do you think I give a shit? That‚Äôs simply the mentality of someone who think they are better than other people. 

In general I just believed I deserved to have the best things in life and I deserved to have them handed to me on a plate. Why should I work hard and save up for things like everyone else when I could just gamble and win them. I was so much smarter than everyone else, I could make this work and people would be asking me what my secret was. I was better than the bookmakers, I could beat them and their odds, I could figure out a system to win. Towards the end I actually abandoned any tipsters or systems because I felt I could just ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the right bet and I would be able to dig myself out of the hole. 

Back in November 2018 I spoke with my current sponsor for the first time ever and we had a chat over text message. I was explaining to him how I had managed to control my gambling on sports, I was proud of this fact by the way, which has not aged well, and I was trying to explain to him that this was something that compulsive gamblers could try. I felt like I was a pioneer, like I had solved life‚Äôs great puzzle, people would thank me for this revelation. Here are some of the deluded messages I sent him;

*‚ÄúI just know personally, I went from having a bet on every minute of every day. ¬£20+ each time. Betting on every horse race in work to now I can put ¬£1 on the NFL game I‚Äôm watching or ¬£5 on the Breeders Cup if I want and walk away. It didn‚Äôt happen overnight either. I stopped for a while.‚Äù*

Jeff was calm and polite and listened to my nonsense while of course explaining to me the benefits and options of recovery. Looking back I can see he made some excellent points, asked me had I tried every reasonable step out there to stop gambling to which I responded with;

*‚ÄúI‚Äôve done none of that. For one reason. I don‚Äôt want to stop some forms of gambling.‚Äù*

Now, what the hell does that have to do with thinking I am better and more important than other people? I honestly thought Jeff was full of shit, that he had no idea what I was saying and that he just did not get that I had figured it out. Reading back through that chat I can see I was trying to convince him that I was right and he was wrong. Everything he threw at me I had an answer for it and it was all bullshit, but I believed that I knew better and that my opinion was more important. Luckily Jeff doesn‚Äôt hold any grudges or didn‚Äôt let that first impression put him off me when I finally entered recovery, funny enough because my sports betting was completely out of control, and he welcomed me with open arms. 

It would be unfair to say I was like this all the time during my addiction but I believe I acted in these ways often enough for it to be considered an issue and something that I need to address in recovery. I believe that my ego was a problem all along and while I have no doubt the addiction amplified it, I have to be honest with myself in recovery and face up to the fact that I was, and still am to an extent, an egotistical person. 

Mark"
688,1,"Day 38-42 and extra workWow, I can‚Äôt believe how many check-ins I‚Äôve missed! I took on a lot of extra work this week partly because we‚Äôve been slammed this month but also because I need as much extra money as I can. As hard as I‚Äôve been working, I still haven‚Äôt made back what I lost in my last gambling session and it‚Äôs been 42 days. Crazy. Whenever I used to take on a little extra work or more jobs than normal before I quit gambling, I‚Äôd take that money as soon as it came in to gamble it away as fast as I could. An extra job or project that would take a week‚Äôs worth of time, I‚Äôd just flush it down a slot machine in a couple of hours like it was nothing because it was ‚Äúextra money‚Äù like so whatever about the whole thing. My attitude about extra work has changed substantially now that I‚Äôm using it to get myself out of gambling debts. There‚Äôs going to be many more years of working at this pace ahead of me and I‚Äôm okay with it. In a strange way, my gambling debt has given me a renewed purpose to work hard because I have to and it‚Äôs made me appreciate the money I am making instead of disregarding it. So here‚Äôs to hard work and very little downtime. Whatever works, right?"
689,1,"So here i am again! Hopeless and on my last legsSo my story starts in 2015. I was working at a pizzaria and started gambling with one guy there through his site. I was 18 at the time and was just learning all about it and was imediatly hooked. I was gambling through him lightly. Maybe 200$ a game 2 or 3 games a week for maybe a month or two. Than right before the superbowl i got my own account. Lost like 2k superbowl sunday and don't think much of it and kept going the next few weeks. I had about 25k saved and thought i was the man and that was a huge ammount of money at the time. Well i blew through that in about a month and a half. Fast foward 5 yeads and i am worse than i've ever been. I have lost easily 300k since the end of 2018 with 150k of that being in the last 2 or 3 months. All too bookies. May i also add that i am an agent for a bookie so i have access to accounrs. I would bet under like 10 diff accounts say 500 an account and have 5k on every single game. This made things so much worse because i had unlimited access to credit. No limit and the bookies think its just players losing. My mom luckily has helped me through this process but she is the only one who knows other than my therapist. I am now on my last leg. She is giving me 40k next week to clear my final debt. I believe she is now in probably 100k of debt herself easy too. I bet tonight still though i dont get it. Every day i wakeup and say im not but i still do and i never win. I have been doing sports lately but in the past it has been live casino on the bookie site as well. Ive even in the past 2 weeks taken money my mom had given me to pay my bookie to tbe local casino and lost it. Safe to say im at rock bottom. Well my point is when will this end. I am seeing a therapist and he is strongly suggesting rehab but my girlfriend that i am madly in love with would 100% leave me im sure of it. He says its only 3 months and i wont muss anything and it will help and i know it will help but i still feel like i can do this myself. So i told him and my mom give me 30 days and if i slip up in these 30 days i will go to rehab no problem. Well guess i have to take this seriously this time and man up and do it. Any wisdom or thoughts would be really appreciated. And sorry for the being all over the place im a little fucked up right now lol

TLDR: been gambling with bookies 5 + years started off losing 1k a week maybe. Now losing 10-50k a week. Mom has been helping me pay she and i are now both in debt with loans. How can i stop please"
690,1,33 days! And life keeps getting better!
691,1,"I can't f*cking stopI've posted in here 1-2 weeks ago, about not having any reason to stop gambling. I've got few responses, but even so, I'm posting again.

I just can't stop betting. I'm doing sports bets, and today I've lost (again) even my very few last food money. It's fucking terrible. I keep losing at one goal, corner, shot on goal, yellow card, things like this, and it makes it even more frustrating. Sometimes it feels unbelievable. I keep chasing my losses, but at the same time I feel like I can win, like I know what I'm doing; yet I lose so many bets. I used to think I'm cursed or something, losing very close bets so many times, yet now I realize there's no way to win on the long term.

From what I've noticed, people around here gamble and do not place sports bets, so maybe you're not familiar with it. I also used to think gambling is pure luck, but sports betting (football especially) can be predicted somehow. Well guess what, even if I predict correctly a lot of events, on the long run I win nothing, on the contrary, I lose every little money I have.

I have a very big gambling problem, yet I can't see any way in changing it. I don't even know how it could help me by posting this. It's just that I lost everything again today, until the next salary, which is low also, and I felt the need to share it here, as I saw some of you are familiar with this...

694,1,"I think I finally did it.. I hopeAfter one year of pure brutal mental torture gambling has given me (winning 25k and losing it all in a few weeks, only to end up 18k in debt) I've finally said ""f\*ck you, casinos"" to myself and closed every account I had, after burning another 200 on gambling. And money is just money, but I will never forgive myself for letting it take more than just that.

* 1 year wasted on gambling, ruining my internship and finals and having to redo the whole year
* Almost got kicked out of my home, I still live with my mom and I took money for her, which made my debts really personal
* Girlfriend I was with for 2 years, broken up. She was the love of my life (still is, we're both taking it slow and building things up together, but I hate how it influenced her as well)
* Barely sleeping, unproductive, distracted, anti-social and miserable, just to name a few side effects i had to deal with
* I lost a good chunk of friends as well due to being THAT focussed on gambling

i'm 20 at the time of writing this. 19 when I started, and I wish I never did."

Proud of myself :‚Äô) ... could never say that about myself before!"
696,1,"I just threw away life changing money.Just posting to get this off my chest. I‚Äôve always enjoyed casinos, maybe a little too much. But I‚Äôve never gone over the line. Usually play $100-$300 and leave. But a few weeks ago I started gambling online for sports. Of course they have an online casino too. Ended up winning big there from a welcome bonus. $10k. Which I turned into $20k a day later. I knew I needed to cash this out ASAP because I would try to just win more and end up losing it all. Unfortunately there is a weekly $2k max withdrawal and even that takes 10 days to go through. 

But 10 days was too long for my dumb ass. I lost $5k one night. Then thinking I could make it back I lost another. Still thinking I could make it back and save my embarrassment I kept betting. I just bet the last dime. Fortunately the $2k withdrawal went through, but I am really beating myself up about the rest. I can‚Äôt believe I did that!! Literally showed my wife when I was at $20k. She was so excited. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to break it to her. I feel so sick. I would consider myself a penny pincher but it‚Äôs like my mindset completely changes when I am gambling. 

Anyway, needed a place to post this. I‚Äôm so broken right now but hopefully it will serve as a reminder in the future. I could‚Äôve changed my life, and it‚Äôs gone."

703,1,"Day 2 feeling betterDay 2, it started small I'd put 10$ in and walk away with any size win or just walk away at 10$, I did this for awhile and it worked fine, then I started winning slightly larger amounts, and I thought if I had betted bigger that would have been a huge win, then it happened I was there every day or every other day if I had a smallish win, it was getting bad but I KNEW I must be due for a big win soon then I'd be out forever, over a period of 6 months I lost about 6k, this was savings but it hurt I could have gone on a holiday I desperately needed. slowly but it kept getting more loses, then I had not a huge win but like 700$ and I stopped for a week happy to have some, that just made it worse you think just 2 more of those and that's good money, so the big bets started and I would lose 400-700$ in a night sometimes I would hit even after losing and Walk out, but I was back the next day, I said no more and stopped for another day, then I got my pay and it was probably my best pay ever as I did a lot of overtime,  I had more then enough for the week plus savings and a little to ""treat myself"" with so I diceded gamble that little extra, and of course lost, which sent me to full addiction mode, I pumped my whole pay in then another 700 on top of it, I walked out and felt sick I had worked a 50hour week for nothing, killed my body for no reason, I didn't even pay any bills, this was the worst lose I've ever had and it felt so bad I needed to buy stuff with that money, I went home in shock hungry and a flood of emotion came out and I cryed in a heaping mess.

Even when I had a small win I'd walk out not feeling good about the hours I wanted in there for no reason.

But with that big loss I'm done I with gambling, it hurt to much and I haven't completely fucked my life yet, I still have some savings to pay my bills, it puts me way behind but I can recover.


So day 2 and I felt that small niggle of addiction, but I said fuck that I'm just gonna lose and the decision not to gamble feels better then any wins ever did.


So if you're struggling at any level, wether it's your first lose or you loat it all, take the decision to empower your life and stop today, treat any money you DON'T put into gambling as a win, and we can all beat this."

Hate myself."
706,1,"Ready to Tell My StoryAfter lurking here for a few months, I am ready to tell my story and quit this terrible, life altering habit. 

It all began 10 years ago when I was involved in a life altering accident that left me disabled. Because the economy was in shambles, my legal team was, at least, able to get me enough money to cover 75% of my medical debts. I was young, still in college, and overwhelmed with the mounting debt from my disability and student loans. My mom took me to the casino one night. With a $300 gamble, I hit $10,000 and it's all been down hill from there. 

Five years after, while I still thought I had gambling under control, was not in debt, 6 figures in savings, and had a decent job-my daughter was born. Her birth invigorated me to stop gambling completely, which I did for about a year. During that year, my other half started to cheat on me and all of a sudden our daughter got incredibly sick. When we lost her, my life fell apart and I started gambling to try and pay the leftover medical debt and, more so, to take my mind off everything. I still was not over my permanent disability, which I never will be, but losing my daughter made life unbearable. My ex and I separated as she turned into a sociopath (I understand that we all grieve in our own ways, but theft and lying were not something I could put up with-the only reason I wanted to work things out with her cheating was for our daughter). 

Fast forward another year, it is now 2015-2016 and I had been gambling heavily to keep my mind off things. What went from casino trips with $300-500 turned into $500-1000, then to $1000-10000 each time. I started burning through my savings, cash advancing all my credit cards, and taking equity out of my home, etc. 

At the same time I met a girl who I fell for instantly. Looking back on things, I probably fell for her because I was looking for an outlet. Regardless, I wanted the relationship far more than she did. She ultimately ended up cheating on me (posting ads on CL, random SLS and Tinder hook-ups while I was traveling for work, etc.) Once again, I was devastated. This sent me into an even harder tailspin and casino trips went from $10k-20k instantly. 

So, with a totally unclear mind and f'd up mentality about money, I got wrapped up into a great business idea that I thought would make my partners and I millions of dollars. To this day I still believe that it would've made us rich beyond our wildest dreams, but my partners, who had more equity in the company than myself to make decisions, were terrible with the money and ultimately allowed their ego's to get the best of them. I lost 6 figures on that deal in the course of a few months and once again returned to gambling in hopes I could somehow get it back, but you know where that went. 

While this was all going on behind the scenes, I was excelling at my job, bringing in all sorts of deals that were growing the company I worked for exponentially YOY. I had a nice commission contract for the deals I was putting together, but I trusted that the company would follow through on their agreement with me...well they didn't. I finally quit when they told me that they weren't going to pay me. I literally handed over a multi-million dollar contract and on the final page, I slipped in my resignation letter. Not getting paid for what I had earned doing my job was really a huge detriment to my gambling addiction as I was constantly seeking the ""win"" that I wasn't getting for doing my job. 

So here we are today. I suspect I have lost between $500-750K over the last decade, but even more time, and it's the time I can't get back. Mixed between slots, blackjack, bad business decisions, and high risk stock options. Never had I won a sizable jackpot over this time, or have a story to tell about how I went on a heater from $2k-50k at the BJ table like so many others here. I have literally never stopped losing during this time, whether while gambling, at my job, or my home life. 

I am writing this at my rock bottom emotionally. I am about $100k in unsecured debt, which I know will take me a couple years to pay off should all things remain constant, which they wont, because my life has gone that way so far. 

I have seen counselors, tried AA, read Alan Carr's book, etc. but I feel like my demons are so deep and so much bad has happened in my life that I am secretly looking for ways to make it worse. That my self esteem is so tarnished that I punish myself with gambling because I know that I will always lose, and the losing feels good because it is what I am used to. 

Just really needed to vent. Today is day 1, again. FWIW I am in my 30's and know I have a lot of life left to live. I just want gambling to no longer be part of it. 

Thanks for reading."
707,1,What is the best online gambling blocker?I've tried alot of online gambling blockers to help my addiction but all of them were too easy to get around. I don't want to say how you can do it but if you know a little bit about computers it only takes a minute. Is there any good gambling blockers you guys recommend?
708,1,"!!Am I at the Right place??First post on reddit friends.
I am problem gambler in early 30s.
Little about my self came from different country as a student.
Was bright student who got scholarship and job at university.
I came from a state were no alcohol and gambling was legal .
Did not do any form of gambling till I was 24.
Than after 6 months in the states saw one of my close friend talking about winning on scratchoff "" I won 100$ today"" I didnt know what he was talking about
I asked him how?
He explained whole scratchoff procedure and I felt like 'wow so easy!'
I was in Texas at that time for my studies and needed car to get around as it was small town with buses coming every hour. So I felt like I should try couple of scratch offs to win some money.
First ticket I won 20 $ from 1$ ticket and it was big win at that time the person who never gambled in life.
I didnt take it as a gambling at that time
I thought it was ""fun"".
That scratch off thing started to happen frequently but not majorly.

One day I was at gas station and one of my friend I saw him coming from backroom
I just asked curiously ""what do they sale there?""

He said they have fruit machines which you can win tickets and pay for your groceries and gas or any merchandise . Come let me show you how if you got ""five""

I went.
He said it's about to hit. It looked like video games kinda machine which I was playing back home with coin .

Pressed few buttons
Bad things started from there my 5$ turned to 250$ 
My friend got excited and he said you owe me 50$.

I was like yeah if I am getting 200 why not!
He went and did his thing to get cash for the tickets.
Gave me 200$.
I was happy.

Week pass by i went that place again
Tried 20$ to do the ""magic"" again. Which did not happen and I left. I was like eh still I won 180$.

Week pass by I went to that gas station again and saw my friend he was upset. I asked what happen? He said he wanted to pay his bill but instead went there and spent half of money in machine so he is going to casino 30 minutes away for ""getting his money back""

CASINO!!!

the place which I have never been to in whole life!

I asked him if I can join him. He said yeah but we will go in my car and I have to pay him 20 because he is broke and he helped me to win money last time.

I was like yeah as I didnt know anything about casino and that 20 can provide me some experiance.



I went to casino in Oklahoma,  saw decorations, machines, and saw people winning, and loosing.

I saw my friend putting 20$ bill I gave him and he started pressing some buttons. He lost it and put another 20 and won something like 350$. He told me to enjoy till he plays poker (I didnt know table games that time)

I went to the machine.
I put 20$ in it and started betting minimum 40 cents.
I was down to 14$ something and was about to cash out after 2 tap as I lost whooping 6$ without single win and I press the button - boom 400$ Win.
I felt the rush and joy.i pressed washout button and kept the ticket as I didnt know what to do with.


After few minutes saw my friend at table and he was playing poker and came out. He asked me why you are happy u win something? I said yea 400$ . He smiled and said ""you lucky bas***. He helped me to cash it out and those crispy Bills felt awesome.  I felt that rush again.

1 month goes by and I have semester break and not going anywhere. One day felt like I should just go to casino which is 30 mins away. Biggest mistake of my life which i regret for 7 years. Till now.

I didnt win that day but after that my visits to casino were frequent.

I lost my 500$ and felt like i gave my winning back. As of now i feel that's when i started feeling it's affecting me.
I didnt feel compulsive that time but didnt like it.


One of the night I was just surfing facebook and I see advertisements of casino jackpots and I was like let me give it a shot. I went ther with my own 250$. Saw people hitting big on5$ slot machine and sat there. Was betting 5$ a spin so money was going fast. At one level I pressed button and the screen turned red.
It spun 3 or 4 time and notice appeared ""call attendant 4000$ win. I couldn't do anything with machine. Attendant came and paid me 4000$ which was 40000$ to me at that time as a full time student.
That win messed me up pretty bad.
I went frequently to casinos. Even made couple of friends which were high rollers.

They took me to winstar - a big casino, won 22000$ that night playing 5 to 25$ slots.

That year I lost value for money. I remember when I was new here I was thinking just to drink tap water instead of Gatorade and now I was throwing money here and there.

I went to the clubs and frequent trips to highrollers.

Was able to graduate with good grades and moved to east cost.



Now  the compulsion begins. Which is destroying my sanity, family, friends and all
Let's do that in part 2 as I dont want to post loong story.




This page has helped me since last few months so just felt posting after attending my 1st GA yesterday..

Thank you guys.
Will be typing soon


Note - english is not my first language so please pardon spelling and grammar mistakes.

710,1,"Im an 18yo winning poker player who just ignited my 3500 usd bankroll on blackjack in a matter of minutes.I now realise that I will never become a pro poker player, as im too impulsive. 100s of hours wasted grinding, i owe my parents money I cant pay them now. Fuck gambling, I am going to apply for a job first thing and pay my parents back as EARLY as fucking possible. I only invested 50 dollars at least, so thats a positive... feel like shit though, dont know how to tell the people that I have bragged too about my poker ability that I blew it all on blackjack like an idiot. It all started with some boredom, then a rush of nervous anticipation as I placed a 5 dollar bet on blackjack, then all of a sudden im in a cold sweat filled with dread playing 5 hands at a time with 200 usd placed on each. Fuck this. Im quitting poker too as although I know im good enough to create a side-career from it, I cant trust that I wont just degen the money away. Addiction is terrifying me, and I just feel like shit. No 18 year old should have to know what it feels like to lose 6k AUD in one night. Im afraid that the min wage job I get will feel too meaningless compared to the money I can make from poker, but at least it goes straight into my account and has no risk attached. Sorry for the rant its 5 am and I havent slept.."
711,1,Day 5Just for today I will not gamble.
712,1,"The minute your environment changes , your obsession follows. Stop being selfish , start being selfless. It all comes with baby steps and begins from awareness. Drop that ego and begin the journey in meeting you."
713,1,"Day 1Im a 26 year old male from Vegas. Now that i‚Äôve found this sub I‚Äôm officially calling it quits after gambling since Ive been of legal age. Being from Vegas certainly makes it difficult but a gambler always finds a way so it doesn‚Äôt make too much difference for me. Keno and cocaine are my vices. Though they do exist on their own, when I gamble high it‚Äôs always so much worse because I can‚Äôt walk away even when I‚Äôm up. I have an amazing girlfriend that I hide my other life from of course. That being said she is an independent woman with self respect and so it has come up in conversation that if I were to be a gambler (addicted) that she wouldn‚Äôt be with me (ouch...understandable). She‚Äôs the most important thing in my life and I just can‚Äôt lose her over some stupid shit. We‚Äôve been together almost 2 years and she‚Äôs had her own apartment while I live with my parents (because you guessed it, i can‚Äôt afford shit on my own due to my addiction throughout the years) In order for me to live a normal life and grow with her I have to let my demons go. My last relationship fell apart due to me developing an alcohol addiction in my early 20s under the guise of being young so it‚Äôs fine to be buzzed anytime. That broke my soul since we were so in love at one point and she never did anything but try to make me happy. I can‚Äôt keep doing this to others and my family. I‚Äôve always had an addictive personality I just always thought I could control it, I was wrong. 

Throughout the years I began gambling by playing video keno and poker at bars here. Gradually my bets increased as I noticed the bigger payouts, plus just watching everyone else hit big turned me on to it. for years now I‚Äôve lived psycheck to paycheck because i‚Äôll blow it before I ever get a chance to save anything, not to mention the insane debt to banks and payday loan places i‚Äôve accrued, which i eventually defaulted on and fucked my credit too. I make about 1300-1700 every couple weeks, given that I only have a car payment and live with my parents, i shouldn‚Äôt be where i am. it‚Äôs embarrassing to be the last one living at home and watching everyone else grow, i don‚Äôt like comparing myself to others since i don‚Äôt care what very many people think, but i do want a normal life. a small home with my girl and dog and just be able to take little trips here and there without worrying about the money. I always get really motivated after the depression bout after a bad night but then it fades and i find myself craving the game again. it‚Äôs always about the money too, never for fun unless it‚Äôs sports betting which i‚Äôm a lot better with as far as limits. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúhow much can i come up?‚Äù but it never ends and before you know it you‚Äôre broke again. anyways I‚Äôm rambling now so I‚Äôll just go. here goes nothing."

That's what they all say.. I am well educated, with an amazing job, and a family who is terribly lovely.. Married to the love of my life.. and yeah, don't forget the meth and online gambling addiction.. oh boy, meth and gambling are like the worse kind of combination guys.. no joke

Ya know the moment when the rush kicks in plus the thrill of winning a huge bet, yup, that kind of dopamine trap shit that I'm sure would even make a saint forget his God. You think u have control or at least u think u do, only to wake up and see the huge mess u have put yourself into. The facade of looking happy and hardworking, while at the same time racking an amount of debt that could buy a decent house in cash, yeah, that kind of self destructive nature i am in right now.

With no one to turn to, and being too much of a pussy to tell my lovely wife bout the shit i have put her into..The only way i could get out is to hang myself, but i know the fan will break, coz am a fat fuck too. The amount of money that was down the drain is too much to count for, and i don't have the strength to recall all just see the actual numbers that had been lost. 

Too much debt, with no possible way for a bailout unless I blurt all my stupid life decision to my wife and family, but I know that would kill me, even if I manage to get out off this freaking deep hole, the fact that i told them my problems, would kill me nonetheless.. Because..

&amp;#x200B;

My key takeaways these last two months:

1. It's HARD at first.. Embrace it. Everyone goes at their own pace, just focus on your journey.
2. Attend GA if you can.. find a sponsor, if you can.. and ""keep coming back""
3. Read books (if you enjoy them) .. 'Unu\*k yourself', 'Subtle Art of Not giving a fu\*k' and 'The Power of Habit' are some of my favorites I have read in the last two months.
4. Write down your goals, thoughts, and use a journal to reflect.
5. Try new things and take an inventory of how they make you feel. If they make you feel good, joy and happiness, do those things, as long as it has nothing to do with gambling. Try new hobbies, meet new people and live life one day at a time!
6. Thoughts vs Action- just because you think negative thoughts, doesn't mean you have to act on them. Over time, your mind will adjust to the actions/behaviors you are taking.
7. After gambling podcast, Jocko Willink Podcast, Joe Rogan Podcast, Chris Del'ia podcast (for comic relief) 
8. ONE DAY AT A TIME- this is key.. It's an everyday battle. Just do not bet today. Focus on that
9. The truth will set you free. Be true and honest with yourself and others around you 

Sorry for rambling, but I hope this helps at least one person! 

I'm no preacher here and I have a LONGGG way to go. But i'm so thankful for my GA group, and most importantly, thankful for myself and recovery. 

Cheers to you all!

719,1,I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymoreI don‚Äôt even have the energy to type my story.
720,1,Day 53!!!
721,1,Ugh day 1 again!!!Didn't even get to three days.  Back to the grindstone ...
722,1,Day 14Longest I've gone since I came a problem.gambler about 6 months ago
723,1,"Few weeks ago I might've been debt free now I might be bankrupt and unemployed I mentioned this before in another thread. Essentially early on this year (as in a few weeks ago) I gambled after abstaining for some months and won enough to pay off all my debts - like 5 figures worth. Tried to collect, but the casino stalled it but the fault is mine. I reversed all of the withdrawals after drinking and left only a few (lost ¬£30k). Lost the rest of that plus a few k more. Later on, again I won but also did that after stalling, asking for docs I already provided etc.

I went over my overdraft in the process and pleaded with the bank to extend it while at work in the car park, which they did, payment plan recycling by 600 a month. Got a reprimand for that. I moved back with my parents in 2018 and still currently live here. I usually just go to bed after my 50-55 hour a week s\*\*t job.To be honest, I'm not particularly liked; I might just get fired anyway as I'm still in probation.

Anyway, one day a few weeks ago, informally colleagues were talking about gambling and I foolishly said I lost and won and to stay away. My job depends on a government SC pass. Turns out someone reported me and I have to take the financial checks again. I took them last year but I'm now 3x as much in debt. I may fail. Failure to pass = fired.

I didn't gamble for 3 weeks. Today I've been on the phone to creditors, asking for payment plans to lessen the chances of failing the check.¬†

I ended up depositing ¬£400 and got it up to 1800 and ended losing it all after 9 'even' spins of the roulette wheel came up. I got the 1800 mainly from slots but started losing and went back to roulette. Threw my phone across the room.

This month I can barely afford getting to this s\*\*t work if I don't get fired. But best case scenario is another 18 months living with parents and paying off debt. I'll be almost 40 then. I haven't had a girlfriend in 15 years, obviously no money now. I used to go out socialsing 2 or 3 times a week in my 20s but I guess no one was interested in me. As an average man it's either luck or really pulling the bull by its horns in terms of dating.

I can't believe I lost 9 times in a row again on roulette in 30 mins. I know all the stuff, gamblers' fallacy, odds and all that s\*\*t. Why though. My greedy self wanted 10k, a resemblance of what I got before. Why in terms of losing all the time and why did you not take say 1500 (not that it matters too much),

If I fail the check, it's probably bankruptcy. I took out life insurance back last year and will be very upset if I don't have the option of checking out due to bankruptcy though. If they cancel the life insurance, that means I there will still be debt in someone else's name and I'd have to go on - wouldn't have the option so to say. Having the option paradoxically would make it better.

I've been calmer recently, mainly because I'm finally on an anti depressant that I to f\*\*\*\*\*g presribe myself after 5 others. If I won that money and it went into my bank account and I paid off debts I'd be OK. Too late for many things, but searching for a job in my old town on the coast instead of being miserable here (but no). I'd be a wreck otherwise.

 I got the meeting at work tomorrow (been delayed several times) concerning my employment status. It's 3:30 am. I don't think I will find out for sure - it will likely drag on for weeks further until the vetting agency makes a decision. There aren't many jobs around here and I can't drive. Still need to make a couple of phone calls to creditors for payment plans, but I ended up cracking open wine for the time being.

TL;DR compulsive gambler got into ¬£40k debt while depressed and lving with parents, depsrately wanted to move out and make things right before age 40. On new years eve won for the first time to pay off all debt but spent pending withdrawals,. Chimed in with a discussion my work (which is shit). someone reported and they canceled my required clearance and until i pass a financials check. meeting with boss [tomorrow. best](https://tomorrow.best)  case another 18-24 months of working the job till i move out"

726,1,"iPhone Users and Online GamblingJust a recommendation for anyone with an iPhone that struggles with online gambling. 

I Went to my screen time tab in my settings menu and gave myself access to probably about 30-40 websites (non-gambling), which are really the only ones I‚Äôve ever pulled up on my iPhone. I then gave my phone to my best friend and he set a passcode on my phone which must be entered anytime I try and go to another website or download an app. This has been effective at staving off those impulsive urges to go to Bovada or BetOnline on paydays."

What can I say, I'm lucky. God is great and God's answered my prayers - but some luck I definitely made on my own.

It's 11:07pm and I feel like I still have a lot more work to do. No one's putting a gun to my head if I don't, but tasting the rock bottom has ironically made me determined to push harder, because I don't want to go back.

Not gambling is half of it. Actually more than half of it. Because it consumes you. Stay away from gambling and good things will happen to you too, I'm sure of it.

Things will be harder, let‚Äôs hope i can deal with it."
743,1,"Day 1 again...I am addicted to gambling and lose my entire salary every month after i paid my bills (at least).in december 2018 i lost 20,000‚Ç¨ which i inherited and since then i am losing my hard earned money every month. 

I know my problem and i self excluded myself from every online casino i ever used, but there are new one coming all the time. I even excluded myself from the landbased casino already and now i am banned in the whole country from the casinos (which is good), but asi mentioned earlier, the online casinos still let me register. I am extremely disgusted by myself and if i could i would press a button to exclude me from gambling entirely, but this seems impossible as there are new ones all the time.

I have a question though, i have now requested a visachargeback at one of the casinos for the money i lost last month, does anyone know if these things go through? I just read online that, the casino will ban you and will pass the information on to other casinos (which again would be good).

The weird thing is, everytime i'm broke, i kinda feel relieved because theres no pressure to play until the next paycheck... i hope i can stop entirely"
744,1,"I really screwed up this time.I posted 13 days ago that I lost $20,000. To preface, I only lost $750 from my actual bank account but I was up $20,000 after months of wasted weekends on miraculous football bets and late night online blackjack benders (I still lost approximately $10,000 over a lifetime of degenerate gambling).

Instead of ""breaking even plus some"" I still didn't feel worthy enough. I continued to chase the dream. I lost everything in one morning.

I'm pretty obsessed with numbers. After graduation, I will be $65,000 in debt from student loans which is a given for this generation. I'm also $10,000 in debt from purchasing a used 2005 Subaru Outback after years of car issues and a new MacBook which I needed for work after the processors fried on the old one. $20,000 would have helped me significantly. A lifetime of working endless summers at a non-profit camp, watching animals die at a rescue shelter, serving pancakes, folding jeans, pushing carts, delivering Chinese, scanning barcodes, digging holes, driving across the state as paraprofessional, and spending year in the wilderness at a therapeutic boarding school still never came close to $20,000 worth of savings. I tried to let it go by banning myself from every online casino and sportsbook in NJ. But as you know, a gambler can always find a way to chase the action.

Life was back to normal for a while. I signed up for CrossFit to get in shape for a swan song season of rugby, started my last semester of grad school, and killed it during the first day back of a final internship. I still have major ambitions to Thru-Hike the Appalachian Trail once I graduate. I really want to give myself a much needed respite from staring at laptop screens, succumbing to a uninspired graduate program, and working alongside a desolate workforce within the field of developmental disabilities for 3 years. I could still make it happen with minimal debt if I just stopped gambling.

I had plans to drive up to my friends house for the Superbowl which would be the first weekend I didn't bet on football since 2018. I told them how much money I lost and the effect it had on my life (only people who know). They joked about bringing dice and how much I would gamble after getting drunk. That's all it took.

I reinvested 1k in bitcoin to use for Seals With Clubs Poker. Was up 2k but lost with a 2 pair to a rivered flush. Bet another $950 in 10 straight blackjack loses on Parx online casino. I got really drunk and noticed that bitcoin has rose significantly. With only $100 left in savings, I managed to invest $25,000 by seriously overdrawing my bank account. Bitcoin takes around 7 days to process and another 4 to withdrawal. I basically put my entire life on lay away. If Bitcoin goes down by 5% before 2/3 I will not be able to afford rent or the minimal payment on my personal loan.

I am looking forward to the most anxiety ridden week of my life. All because I can't cope with shit. If I make it out of this. I promise this will be the last gamble I ever make."
745,1,"Day 1, severely depressedIt is day 1 after the horrible relapse. I've never had this kind of a depression after losing. I lost it all, excluded myself, but I lost a huge sum.

Currently severely depressed over money and life choices. I feel like a failure."
746,1,"Time to stopHi everyone, just lost my last 100$ and literally has 0 money now. I'm 28 and have spent last 6 years gambling. Things gone down hill since 2017 when i went abroad to study and started to increase my bet size, i went from betting 1$ per game to throw the whole monthly slary in 1 night. 2019 was a diaster to me. I was struggle to find a new job  (took me almost a year to find one, and i hate it). I kept lying to my friends and relatives to borrow money for my addiction, gain weight uncontrollably with unhealthy diet and sleeping hours. I am reaching my 30s with no savings, no girlfriend, low pay job and over weight issues. It's time for me to stop and get back control of my life. 

This is the list of things i plan to do for the next month:

\+Exercise at least 30 minutes per day. My gambling addiction get worse when i stop exercising in 2017, so i think this is the key for me to get back my normal life and shape 

\+Keep posting this thread as my journal. 

\+Find a new job.

\+Stop lying to other people, stop seeing my gambling friends.

For 6 months, I am down $400. It's just small money for you guys but for us it's big. I am not a permanent resident of this country and would not be sure if I would be as my daughter has some mental illness that would prohibit us in doing so.


My wife and I planned to just save money and if we go back to our original country we would just start over. But fuck this man. Sometimes you just wanna be gone or whatever.


My wife would leave me if she knew I bet, and I will then be again be belittled which, I think i rightly deserve. This disease is killing me. I was able to be sober for quite some time and it feels good, but since I am the one handling the finances again, it's kinda hard.

I think it‚Äôs not the money that bothers me the most, it‚Äôs the person that gambling has turned me into. I can‚Äôt believe the deceitful things I have done because of this addiction. 

I also feel boring and bored. On the rare weekends that I resist gambling I find that nothing gives me the same highs that gambling does. Sounds silly but I worry that I‚Äôve rewired my brain to not enjoy the ‚Äòsimple‚Äô pleasures any more and I‚Äôll feel this empty/numb forever. I hope it comes back."

I often try and remind myself of the night I lost every penny in my bank account and then took out a payday loan and lost all of that too. I know I'm better than that and I'm really happy to have made it this far.

Hope you guys are doing fine, I read your posts daily and it really helps.

764,1,"Denial (and day 300)My name is Mark and I am a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. This was a topic at a recent Problem Gambling Support Group Skype meeting and it was something I wanted to explore in more via writing as I got so much out of the meeting itself. The topic was framed as ‚ÄúThe Role of Denial In Addiction -denial is central to the explanation of why gambling addicts persist despite evidence of harmful consequences‚Äù. The following questions were discussed: 

**- During active addiction, do you believe you were in denial?**

Looking back it is clear to me that I was in denial during my active addiction and there are so many different situations that prove this but I think my daily routine when I had money is a perfect example when looking back. The first thing I thought about when I woke up was gambling, I would literally turn my alarm off and log onto my account and check if what I fell asleep betting on overnight won or lost and what was currently in-play. I would be making my kids breakfast with one eye on whatever bet I had placed, it was like the fix I needed to start my day. I would drive to work gambling on Australian Basketball, tennis in Japan or some Indonesian Division 2 football, again keeping one eye on that as I was driving. The minute a bet won or lost, I needed to get my next bet placed. This would continue on throughout the day at work, sitting at my desk doing the bare minimum to get by while betting flat out on whatever sport I could. At lunchtime I would go out for a smoke with my friends and completely zone out of the conversation staring at my phone on whatever bet I was waiting on. If they asked me did I have a bet on I‚Äôd lie and say no my partner was messaging me and put my phone away. For those 5-10 minutes I was filled with an internal rage and hatred it is hard to even fathom in recovery but at that point I detested making conversation with them and couldn‚Äôt wait to get away to check how my bet was getting on. I would get home, having gambled on the drive home of course, and my kids would be delighted to see me. They‚Äôd be waiting at the door and waving and I would come in and do my best to pretend I was interested and take myself into the kitchen to make their dinner while using this time to watch whatever bet was on. At this stage my Daughter was obsessed with having my phone so I would give her that and switch to my laptop which I would then carry, open, from room to room. I would get my kids to bed and would have zero patience for their messing about and normally ended up shouting at them because they were keeping me from gambling. The rest of the evening would be spent with me on one sofa, her indoors on another, me ignoring her and just gambling until she went to bed. Then I would continue gambling and fall asleep on the sofa. I assumed back then this was normal behaviour and that gambling was not an issue for me.

**- Were you aware of the destruction your gambling was causing, or did you have your 'head in the sand'?**

I mentioned an internal rage and hatred earlier on and that was present on many occasions during my active addiction. If I couldn‚Äôt get a bet on, due to there being nothing on in-play (which was rare but did happen) it would be there. If I was asked to do something when I was gambling online, such as answer a simple question or nip to the shop, it would be there. I would storm out of the house saying something nasty to my partner and blaming her for not telling me we needed something when I was on my way home from work. I would cause arguments in the house we were were going out somewhere because I was annoyed it was getting in the way of my betting. 

My Mum had Cancer during my active addiction and I barely made an effort to speak to her or ask her how things were going. I just assumed everything would be fine and someone would let me know if it wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt think about how she was feeling, I hardly went round to their house (they live literally 5 minutes away) and when I did, I just sat on my phone gambling. It was the same when my Granda was sick, I was emotionally detached from it all. When he died, I didn‚Äôt understand why people were crying at the funeral and getting so emotional, I didn‚Äôt feel anything. There were times my Daughter was in the hospital and I would sit in the hospital waiting rooms gambling on my phone while my partner was doing the real parenting or she would sit the whole night in A&amp;E and I would get to stay at home to mind our Son and I could just gamble away in peace. Writing that now is upsetting, embarrassing and shameful all rolled into one but there is no point lying about it, that‚Äôs how I felt at the time.

So there are some prime examples of damage being caused to those closest to me and I just had my head in the sand. When it came to finances there was no way I was not aware of the destruction it was causing me. When I ran out of money I started doing spreadsheets and budgets figuring out how I would make it through the month and then how I would change my ways from the following payday and start paying things off. I would budget years into the future, writing down everything and how I would be able to fix things as long as I didn‚Äôt gamble the following month...and then I would gamble the second my salary hit my bank account because I believed that this month I could make it work and win my way out of trouble.

**- How did you justify your gambling?**

I was able to justify my gambling to myself pretty easily, it was my money. The rent and food money was always given to my partner and the rest was my own money to do with what I wanted...only that wasn‚Äôt exactly true. I had direct debits for the house I was responsible for but I worked out the best way to bounce those. 

My attitude was pretty much that I worked for my money and if I wanted to ‚Äúrelax and unwind‚Äù with a bet then that is my choice. I had my Son at 25 and my Daughter at 29, I didn‚Äôt go out anymore and drink or socialise. So gambling was my entertainment and my way to enjoy myself. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwaste‚Äù money on clothes or food or video games, so I was entitled to treat myself to a bet or two. My partner stayed at home while I worked and I hardly had any money as it was so if I wanted a bet that was my choice. 

I had this belief in my head that I worked hard and was hard done by, that I wasn‚Äôt appreciated at home. I thought if I did the dishes I deserved a gold star and if I did some cleaning my partner better organise a parade. So if no one was going to appreciate me I would turn to gambling as I felt it always treated me right.

**- Was there a pivotal moment that brought you out of denial and into reality? What was it?**

I have written before about the weekend prior to entering recovery and that was the pivotal moment. Without going into the details I‚Äôll just say it was an up and down roller coaster of emotions and money that ended up with me at zero. It was at that point something in my head clicked and realised I was never going to be able to win my way out of this mess, it was only going to get worse. The question was did I want to own up and face the consequences or did I want to keep digging? For me the consequences of telling my partner was her kicking me out and me not being able to see my kids every day, that scared me to death. I can still remember the day I told my partner vividly. She had went to the gym with her friend and I was pacing around the living room with a notebook in my hand. Earlier that day a friend of mine in work realised I wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äúusual‚Äù self and asked if I wanted to go for a drink at lunch. So I did and told him what was going on. He was great and listened and said he reckons I should tell my partner and get the help I needed. So I wrote out all my debts, my budget going forward and my closest G.A. meeting, just in case I would forget anything when I was telling her. So her friends car pulls up after the gym and she comes in and sits down. At this point I am still 50/50 in my head if I am going to tell her or not and my head is spinning. Then she starts telling me about the gym and how she got on and I was thinking to myself, ‚ÄúWHO THE F\*\*K CARES ABOUT THE F\*\*KING GYM! I‚ÄôM TRYING TO DECIDE IF I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT MY GAMBLING ADDICTION!‚Äù My heart is beating so fast at this point like it‚Äôs going to jump out of my chest and I am panicking. So she finally stops talking and I just spit it out that I have a gambling problem and need help. I was crying, not for sympathy but because of the relief of finally admitting it, not only to her, but to myself, for the first time. I handed her the notebook and I was just waiting for her to throw me out but she didn‚Äôt, she stood by me. Got me to call round my parents and tell them and that‚Äôs when I officially entered recovery.

I really got a lot out of reflecting back at this topic as I do feel like it‚Äôs an important part of recovery, a reminder of why I don‚Äôt want to go back. I was telling one of my mates who I gambled with about a few of my stories the other day from when I was gambling. I‚Äôve spoken to him before about them since I entered recovery. Things like how I would borrow money or bounce direct debits or apply for credit just so I could gamble. The sorts of random things I would gamble on or crazy bets I would do. I would tell him these stories and each time he says the same thing to me and it is probably what any normal person would say when they find out the details of what I was doing. I feel it also proves how in denial I was during my active addiction when he would simply respond with, ‚Äúhow the f\*\*k did you sleep at night.‚Äù

766,1,"Day 1Just returning from an incredible trip to Vegas. The reason is because I was lucky after placing ridiculous bets. I‚Äôm walking away with my biggest haul ever and after years of compulsive tendencies and reckless justifications, I‚Äôm done. I have two futures bets that will go to savings if they pay. Everything else goes to savings today. I am not going to give into the high I‚Äôve been riding all weekend for the rest of my life. Today is Day 1 of me growing up."
767,1,"Take no for an answerWhat I'm finding with gamblers is that the addiction gets a hook by turning our psychology against us.

These are some examples:

A) People who can't take 'no' for an answer, and who think if they keep pushing then the person/machine will give them what they want.   You can see how this mindset can turn into a massive gambling problem.
The machines are wired to say No, so getting into a battle of wills with slots is going to backfire.  

b) People who are too naive and believe in equal give/take. Think that if they are 'nice' to the machine then the machine will be fair and give them a good win.

c) People who are taught to accept a one-sided deal, with them on the losing end.  The machine can keep on taking from us and we are already wired to accept that. 

d) People who believe that the odds must always be stacked in their favour. That they have to win no matter what. Yeah, the machines will exploit that chink mate. 

e). People who accept bad trearment. The machines mirror abuse/exploitation.

f). People who are already stuck in another negative situation e.g work,identity, illness, marriage, family but see no easy way out. You are forced to keep going despite it being a lose situation.    The machines piggyback in on this.

g) Something for nothing/get rich quick mindset. Yeah, the machines are getting rich quick off the money you could have used to start a business, save, or pay off debts.

h) You're lonely. The machines keep you company but damn, they are terrible fake mates or 'lovers'.  

i) You're greedy.  The machines are your mirror, out to get every penny.

k) Trauma. Some life gamble backfired or you got shafted by someone. You are reliving this via addiction.  Any therapy is cheaper than gambling.

Action plan.
Identify if any of the above apply to you. Or scout for other themes. 
Work through these to detect the 'energy'. See if it reduces the energy being directed into gambling.  Re-routing and dispersing the energy into other activities is also needed.   With addiction, all that energy is being routed along one channel."

Cleared out my IRA over the last year, ran around town until I could find somewhere to get cash from my credit cards. Owe 20k on those cards.

My story isn't anything special. Started gambling 10-12 years ago. Only did so on trips to the casino though. A few hundred bucks here and there but the drive was over an hour so I didn't go too often. Cards, slots whatever. Just enjoyed the rush.
Things went very quickly downhill when I stopped drinking last year. They say you have to watch out for addiction whack a mole. Quash one and another pops up. I filled the time I used to spend at the bar with gambling in the slot parlors that are on every street corner of my new town. I enjoyed the rush, the activity. Even enjoyed the sneakiness of getting away and not telling anyone where I'd be. Now I'm out a years salary and feel like an idiot. I went every day. Sometimes more than once a day. Never came out ahead. If I won anything more than I started with it would go right back in. I majored in statistics but apparently didn't retain anything. Knew I wouldn't beat the house but tried thousands of times.

Anyway, I've wanted to post for the last few months. Maybe getting my story on paper so to speak will help."
778,1,Day 22Im in total disbelief with the news of Kobe passing away. I haven‚Äôt been this emotional in a long time
779,1,"2 years without a bet, settle off all my debts: a bit of a long read but I‚Äôll try and be conciseIt‚Äôs been two years since my last bet. I was married for less than 2 years and I hid everything from my wife. My smoking and my secretive gambling, she had no clue. A woman who gave up everything to marry the man she believes was her soulmate. And I lied to her everyday for most of our marriage. 

When we first started dating, in the course of the 2013 NFL season, I lost weeks 1-16. Only 100 dollars a week on 7-8 team parlays. Week 17, I hit a parlay and make $7,888! Following season I made over 20k in NFL betting. 

2015 season I made about 12k. And then I got married in 2016. My wife and I went to a casino twice that summer after we got married and I had just learned how to play Craps. I must‚Äôve won about $3500 and we were having a blast. But then the 2016 season came and it wasn‚Äôt my best year. What also happened is I got sucked into online casinos. And playing 100 dollar rolls in online craps was a disaster. 

Any money I won during the NFL season just went into the online casinos. And I knew at that point that I had no control. But I was resilient and would win the money back. 

Spring of 2017, I was in about $30k in debt. Found a new job and rolled my 401k to an IRA. I had access to $160k... figured I would withdraw enough to pay off all my debt and just let the rest of the money sit. I hit a parlay in January that year and when I withdrew the money, I was paid in Bitcoin. 

Long story short, that summer I was making tens of thousands of dollars from alt coins I bought in the spring. I made about $25k in Ethereum and about $12k in Litecoin. Also made money in bitcoin. I‚Äôd win money playing roulette, withdraw the funds into my bitcoin account and I‚Äôd let it stay there for a few days and make even more money. 

I was playing online roulette for an entire summer. I‚Äôd buy bitcoin and send it to my offshore account to gamble on Roulette. Roulette, I knew how the wheel spun. I‚Äôd deposit $1,000 and would make between 5-6K, do a withdrawal to then cancel it 2 minutes later. This vicious cycle went on until the 2017 NFL season. Which was my best football season yet. 

By November, I had made about 35k in NFL betting but lost all of it, and the rest of my IRA (remember that $160k???). Where to go... what to do? I applied for another personal loan. To consolidate all my debt and got a $65k loan. That weekend, thanksgiving weekend, I made another $14k on the NFL games. And then a month later I was broke again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get another massive loan, and then I‚Äôm done‚Äù

Only this time, my loan was for only $20k because I had so much debt. A mortgage and about $125k of debt on top of it. 

I called my old boss and cried like a little bitch to her, asking her for a bailout. Asked her to give me a loan of $50k. That in 2 years I‚Äôd pay her back. She probably has a net worth of $20-30 million. She said no. And I couldn‚Äôt believe it. She said I was like a son to her and she wouldn‚Äôt help me get out of debt?????

January 18, I got on a plane to go see my wife who was visiting her family (she still doesn‚Äôt know anything yet) and the plane had SO MUCH TURBULENCe, I was praying for a crash. I did not want to deal with the consequences of my actions. 

January 25, my wife confronted me and I had no more answers. No more lies to tell. I was done, finished. I had to tell her the truth. She then told my parents everything and then I had to tell them what I had done. Seeing the look on my parents‚Äô face, two people who didn‚Äôt gambled at all. Blue collar workers who couldn‚Äôt fathom the money I made, let alone the money I gambled away and the debt I had. Sent them home crying. Couldn‚Äôt believe their son, their most successful child, had done this to himself. 

And then My wife had said some of the most vile shit to me. And I deserved it. We were up until 1-2 AM but then she had to get some rest because she had work. She went to work the next day  and I had the day to reflect on what I had done. Made a decision at that point, whether she stays or goes, that I need to stop gambling. Besides not having money to gamble, I needed more than that to stop gambling. 

I found gamblers anonymous. I just googled ‚Äúhow to stop gambling‚Äù and that showed up. Told my wife I would start going to GA. She didn‚Äôt care. She made her decision to leave. January 29th, I went to my first GA meeting and my wife that day, told her mother what happened. She had already told her dad, but now she told her mother. And her mother pleaded with her to give me another chance. He can change. I used to say people don‚Äôt change. They never change. They show you who they are... believe them. 

My wife cancelled her plane ticket and said: ok. One last chance. 

Here we are. Two years later.  Haven‚Äôt gambled. No longer smoke. We have a child of our own now. Hired a law firm to help me settle my debts. Had my debt cut down from $146k to $90k. Paid that law firm about $20-22k in fees. In two years. Every penny I made went to pay off my debt as quickly as I could. Hindsight, I would have gone a different way in paying off my debts. But I was desperate and did whatever my wife said to do. 

Doing the math recently, I must‚Äôve lost $400k-$500k in about 15 months. I did more damage in 15 months than some people do in 15 years. The moral of this story: I was wrong. People CAN change. GA saved my life. It has helped me and so many other people. If you believe you have a gambling problem and want to stop gambling, you CAN. Find a gamblers anonymous near you. Go to a meeting. It‚Äôll change your life. It changed mine. 

Peace and love. Peace and love."
780,1,Day 28.
781,1,"34 yr old male - struggling..Typing on my phone so apologize for any typos. Also a really long post so thanks for reading in advance. Lost $5k from BJ and Baccarat from Vegas after being 4k up so 9k swing overall. Did a 5 year self-exclusion from all Caesars properties (did my first 5 year exclusion after losing like 10k back in 2013 and recently reinstated myself this past Dec). From Southern California and was taking trips to Vegas every wkend and was doing well until this trip and told myself would self-exclude again if I lost.

3k of the 5k is a payday loan so I'll have to sell stock (again) to pay it back asap since interest rates are astronomical. Thankfully I didn't bring any credit cards (I actually dont have any with me at home and have only been using debit).

Anyway I'm just really struggling as the past decade has been just about gambling. I love baccarat and it gets me such a high I just find it difficult to have a replacement. I don't have any hobbies and work is well..work (I like my company and team and make decent $ but I wouldn't say I'm passionate about what I do.. ). However, I'm single and don't have any financial responsibilities (no house/mortgage, rent is low, and car is paid off).

Over the last decade I've prob lost at least 100k but I wouldn't be surprised if it's closer to 200k...thankfully I've always been diligent with my 401k, Roth but I just feel so ashamed about the whole thing. Friends are getting married and buying homes while im just trudging along getting myself in debt.

The other thing is I'm also addicted to stocks. I'm not a day trader but my stock portfolio consists of three biotech stocks and I can't help myself from checking the tickers every couple minutes. I'm afraid to sell for fomo but I know it's pure gambling and even if the stock were to triple I'll eventually lose it all on some other speculative stock. Right now I'm thinking of selling all the stocks and going all in on Uber but that's another post for another day.

Anyway thank you for letting me vent. One last thing I wanted to know is what strategies you all have employed to restrict access to money. Right now I'm thinking of just maxing out my 401k with post-tax funds (thankfully 401k doesn't allow me to trade individual stocks otherwise I'd be screwed). The other thing I wanted to know is if that's a way to direct my paychecks to a fund or something I can't touch? The hardest has always been payday and even though I know I could easily transfer my paychecks from my checking account to vanguard or whatever, the struggle for me has always been that one/two day lag between when my paycheck hits my checking account to when it gets transferred to a mutual fund. Is there a way somehow to direct my paychecks directly to something? Anything will work as long as I don't have immediate access to funds (again this is also why I don't have credit cards)...

Anyway thank you all for reading and really appreciate any input provided."

Their black widow slot machines
are programmed to mesmerise. 
To decapitate your will and reason

its web of addiction around you.

Coffee with sugar, miss and mr? 
Enjoy the bookie's hospitality!
The caffeine and sugar freebies 
jack you up for playing a long one,

whose jackpot is long gone.

So the 'fun' goes on and on, from 10 till 5pm. 
From 5pm till 4am until your very last coin disappears down the pan - again.

As the curtains fall on the silent reel,
the machines will temporarily release you - 
their droid from your long trance. 
A pick pocket won't waste time picking empty pockets. 
No cash? Ah, poor you.
The machine offers no second chance. 

But you will return to chase the same outcome.
The slot lobotomy ensures a downward spiral for the poor sods who accept the spinning reels and roulette for company. 
The damage is FAR from being done.

Slots are designed to pose-essss.
How else could they take your mind off the fact - it takes you four weeks to earn your salary, but the machines get the lot - in a few hours, or less.

They are not a harmless tryst with fate.
Not unless your mates are psychopaths and thieves -

Or scammers!

Damn. You wouldn't be mugged by such an obvious scam.

784,1,Any tips on breaking a habit?So I love taking baths and hitting the slots on my phone. I want to quit gambling but I also love taking baths. Any one have any tips on reducing the urges while doing something you used to do while gambling?
785,1,"It always gets worse if we continue onI realized about 2 months ago that I have a huge gambling problem (sports betting). I even posted here about it and now I am actually in debt because of gambling for the first time. I should have about 10k in my bank account, instead I am 2k in debt which is insane to think about for me. I stayed off gambling for a month from december to january, but now I lost another 1.5k. 

I lost my motivation to work if I am just going to gamble it away. The bottom line is I think most of you think you can win some of it back or even win it all back and then quit, but it usually never happens and this cycle can go on for years. Really disgusted at myself right now."

Why can‚Äôt I just go for fun, have a few drinks, win a couple hundred bucks and call it a day? Thought number two: I wonder if he‚Äôll return since he won a little bit and end up like me? It really can go one of two ways. I hope for his sake and his family‚Äôs sake it‚Äôs not the latter."
787,1,"Flatmate stole money and admitted gambling addictionFirst and foremost, I'm not asking for any legal advice.

Tl;dr at the bottom

Background: 

I'm a university student and live in a house together with some other students. We all have our own rooms and have shared bathrooms and a shared kitchen. The landlord is pretty chill, rent is affordable and we all get along quite well. As for the latter, none of us ever saw a reason for locking our doors to our rooms, cause what could go wrong?


Story:

Last September, 2 guys moved out and 2 new guys moved in at the beginning of the new semester. A few weeks later, money started to disappear, adding up to a few hundred bucks. The 2 new blokes also claimed to be among the victims. Our own investigations led to nothing as we all have (girl-) friends staying over every now and then and a lot of other people could have stolen cash in our house. We figured that something must be wrong with one of the new guys, but had no evidence. 

Months went by and as we started to lock our doors regularly, no more thefts occured. Eventually, one of the new guys (A) went to a town near my hometown for a week and I refferd him to some friends of mine to have a place to crash. While he was there, my friend (B) called me and asked in an oddly specific way, if A has any financial problems. Guess what, he stole some cash from B.

We told our landlord about the new development in the case and he told us that the evidence is sufficient to justify an eviction. Problem solved, one might think. 

Upon his return and confronted with the issue, A admitted everything, that he stole all the money. And he told us that he has a problem with gambling. He told us some more personal details and that he has accumulated a total debt amounting to a five digit number. He also told us that he wants to seek professional help.


What to do now? 

No here is the dilemma we face in our house. Some of us want him evicted to return to the status quo in which we can live happily without having to be afraid of being robbed in our own house. Some of us also want to help A, so he doesn't fall in a deeper hole with his crippling debt. For example, help him to get professional help and make a therapy and help him in some way to get his addiction under control. Our landlord is like ""as long as he pays his rent I don't care, you decide. If you want him evicted, just say so""

Kicking him out seems to be the most convenient way, but to me it also feels morally wrong. Who knows what will happen to him? And also, as long as he doesn't steal, he's a good kid and I don't want to see him destroy his life by being crushed under crippling debt and eventually ending up in jail or whereever for theft or whatever crimes he might commit to get money for his gambling.

Any ideas if and how we could help him? 


Tl;dr
Flatmate stole money and admitted that he took it to finance his gambling addiction.
Option 1: Kick him out of the house
Option 2: Try to help him, but how?"

I feel good because i know i dont have to bet anymore because i got bored of this stupid habit and dont have any interest in chasing up those lose because i started with very small amount. I should've cash it out and quite but i decided to make this decision. Now i think back and still dont understand my decision that i've made. Anyone ever feel this way? It's so weird

As time went on, he began opening up to me, how he has gambling for nearly 40 years, and lost his house and marriage due to gambling. He was $500k in debt, and that during that day alone, he lost $17k. 

In my mind, I'm thinking this fella is too blatant and exposing himself loudly. The whole pit of casino workers seems to know him. He appears to be a successful and rich guy once upon a time but clearly has a gambling problem.

He loudly goes on to say, ""I'm in a black hole, no therapist can help me, I'm only paying the interest on my debt. I continue to gamble as this is my way out. Either that or death.""

I don't work don't have friends or a partner so that makes it hard for support, I have 2 older teenagers and they know I gamble but I can't put my problems with gambling on them. Even though I have financially and emotionally. I want to stop and I hope this week is the start of my recovery for good. I am starting to see a psychologist again so some support.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there were plenty of times I wanted to put my fist through a slot machine after it cleaned me out of all my money, but I never felt compelled to tap or bang on one for ‚Äúluck‚Äù or will. I also don‚Äôt miss seeing really angry players kicking and cursing and hitting their machines.

801,1,"Last attempt. Day 1.I‚Äôve tried to quit over 100 times. Hell it may be even closer to 200. The last 3 years have been an absolute zombie gambling crisis. First it was booze and gambling. Then it was aderall, booze, and gambling. Now it‚Äôs aderall, cocaine, booze, and gambling. It‚Äôs a literally lighting money on fire as I have no concept of a dollar and don‚Äôt stop til every bit I have is gone. This sick part is I make close to 175K a year and I‚Äôve been making 6 figures for over 10 years. I declared chapter 11 bankruptcy at 27 with 100k in loans and credit card debt. My accounts are all overdrawn by the thousands and I have multiple payday loans. I had previously handed over control of the finances when I told my wife about my gambling problems. She stayed and said we can get thru this if you stop. 

I didn‚Äôt stop. It got worse as you saw. I ALWAYS found a way to gamble. I‚Äôm deeply ashamed of some things I‚Äôve done to get money to gamble. Needless to say my wife who I‚Äôve been with since I‚Äôm 16 is now leaving me, I‚Äôm 33. We were high school sweethearts. She‚Äôs honestly of the most amazing people I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôve watched myself destroy something so pure and good. I started to do some rough math and since I‚Äôve turned 21 I am down close to 1 million dollars. 

I literally just destroyed a brand new MacBook Air bc I couldn‚Äôt stand what it stood for. ALL I used the fing thing for was to gamble. It will save me money in the end if I do quit. I say my last attempt bc of I don‚Äôt fix this now I can‚Äôt live any longer. Pretty sure I need to go to rehab for the drug addictions but I‚Äôm also pretty sure I‚Äôll lose my job. I think at this point I just suck it up and go bc if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be dead soon. 

I had to get this off my chest and I‚Äôm sure some other fellow addicts may be able to related to bits of this. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but I know WHAT to do to stop, GA, finding hobbies, accountability, etc. I guess all this time I just wasn‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôve finally lost something that means more than money.

I‚Äôve been in recovery for over 6 years, with a couple relapses, my first meeting was when I was 18 (28 now) 
They say that gambling addiction is a progressive disease, and in my experience that is a true statement. 
So at 18 to 22, I was getting paid my wage and within days it would be gone, using payday loans to further gamble/ get me by, as I had next to no financial commitments, I justified that it was ok. I went to meetings for a couple months then decided that I knew better/cured as I hadn‚Äôt gambled for a little while. 
BOY was I wrong, it was 4 years of hell, being in denial, gambling excessively, taking out more payday loans, (25 over 2 years), big bank loan, credit card, again wages. I remember having to put on a face that everything was ok with me, even though inside I was hurting, confused, as to why I hadn‚Äôt had my big break yet... convincing myself that one day I‚Äôll win loads of money and be happy, that everyone will love me more because of having loads of money.
 The book described this dream world that I once believed in... 
Then that day came, one night of gambling online, roulette was my vice, I had a winning streak. I won more than I ever thought possible, I stopped myself and pulled the plug from the laptop and told myself FINALLY, finally I can stop gambling. A few minutes passed.. and I was itching to win more money and keep going, so I plugged my laptop back in, reversed the withdrawal requests for what I had won. And went on a losing streak, I lost 3/4 of it in a few hours and felt physically sick, as it would of got me out of debt and some left over, I didn‚Äôt sleep for two whole days as my mind was working overtime as to what the hell I had just done... heart feeling like it was beating out of my chest. Somehow I withdraw the remaining (1/4) money. Within a week it was all gone, gambled in desperation to chase my loses. 
The problem is, with more money, my bets just got bigger... so I now believe no matter how much I could win, it will only go back, plus more. 
So what‚Äôs the point?
You‚Äôd think just knowing that on its own is enough to stop .. But that isn‚Äôt enough for an addict like me, I go to two meetings a week to remind myself of what I was like
How many times did I gamble until my last ¬£ pound was gone, then do the exact same thing the following month, after month...

The feeling I have when I think about 5 months sobriety is the same feeling when I was in 7th grade and had my first boyfriend. Just thinking about it makes me smile. And makes me all warm inside. So that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to treat my sobriety- like it‚Äôs the new love of my life. I will do anything to keep it.

And everyone is just living in the future hoping to repeat that big win that once had. I walk out there with empty pockets and my energy just drained. im slightly more negative and this mood stays with me til the next day. And whatever free time my parents have, they go gamble so Im always invited and i dont have to use my own money. So it's like why am i feeling negative when i could possibly win for free? Well I've seen my mom win $400 when she had less than $40. Then put half of it back. Then complain later there's  bills that need to be paid. That's the draining energy the casino brings. And they can't stop. My reason to quit is i want to be more productive in my life and work for my money where it isn't random to get paid. Where your brain and dopamine isn't always getting fucked with. Then that will feel normal. Then you can be responsible. gambling sucks, literally. Ive seen the same people for over a year now, in the same spots. There habits never change. Its almost as if theyre chained down to the ground forever."

838,1,"Early Stages of Recovery: What Worked For MeI wrote this back in June but still stand by what I have written. This is the foundation my recovery has been built on.

My name is Mark and I‚Äôm a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. I just wanted to take the opportunity to write down what has worked for me early in my recovery. Not only will this give me something to refer back to but maybe it will also help someone who is struggling with recovery. I cannot tell anyone what they should or should not be doing, all I can do is share what is working for me and if someone can use this to stay off a bet then that is a bonus.

1. Telling my partner and family everything ‚Äì In my experience this is something that is impossible to do alone, I have tried in the past and failed miserably. It got to the point where the only person I was letting down by gambling again was myself and I didn‚Äôt care about letting myself down. This time I sat my partner down and told her I had a gambling problem and needed help. I have two young kids so there was a lot to risk by doing this, but it was the right thing to do. Then I sat my Mum and Dad down and told them the same thing. I personally extended this out to friends and people in work, the more people that know then the bigger the support network. For me though it was a vital step to admit to those closest to me that I could not do this on my own.
2. Money ‚Äì Before I sat down with my partner I wrote out all the debts I had in a notebook, every single one, to the exact penny. There‚Äôs no point going into this hiding one debt, recovery is about being open and honest. I also wrote out a budget and again, this was to the penny. I then worked out how I was going to pay my debts back and in what order and how my budget would work going forward. I have not over exerted myself when it comes to paying my debts, why put added pressure on the situation. I am currently paying 10% of my salary towards my debts each month and it will take ten years to pay back, I am fine with that. Another massive barrier I set up was to give my partner full control of my main bank account that my salary is paid in  to and my bills are paid out from. I do not have access to this card and she has the app on her phone. I have another bank account which she knows about and I get money paid in each month which is to cover petrol and money for me for the month. It is a Monzo account which has a function to block gambling transactions; if you are in the UK I would highly recommend it. My partner can also check this bank account at any time to make sure everything is as it should be. If I pay for anything in cash I make sure I get receipts so I have a record of what that money was used for. People may say this is being treated like a child, that by doing this I cannot be trusted with money, and they would be absolutely right. I have a long track record of proving I cannot be trusted with money so why run the risk.
3. Self-Exclusion/GAMSTOP ‚Äì As most of my gambling was online, especially for the last number of years, self exclusion was a must. Luckily in the UK we have a scheme called GAMSTOP which will self exclude you from the majority of online bookmakers, casinos, bingo sites etc. for up to 5 years. I have self-excluded in the past from a bookmaker or two but always left other ones open and each time I went back to them. I needed to close the door on all sites online and GAMSTOP has allowed me to do this. Now, when I initially tried to sign up for GAMSTOP I could not be verified, turns out I was answering a question wrong. So what I did, and this is an example for those outside the UK, I went through my emails and text messages and every bookmaker or casino I had received marketing from I logged on to each one individually and self excluded for the maximum time. 5 years was the only option for me and I would have chosen a lifetime self exclusion if it was available. To self exclude for any less time would have been my way of telling myself I could control this in the future. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I am a compulsive gambler and one bet is all it will take to send me back to where I was before April 2nd 2019.
4. Gamblers Anonymous ‚Äì Once I decided I was going to admit I needed help I looked for nearby G.A. meetings. I checked for times that I knew would suit me and that I would be able to make weekly. I found one in Newry that has a Monday meeting between 9pm and 10:30pm and I knew I had no plans for this time, so no excuses. I travel around 25 miles to get there and it is one of the best things I have done in my recovery. I was talking to someone towards the end of 2018 about my gambling and they had mentioned G.A. but I said I wasn‚Äôt that bad, I was wrong. I had all these preconceived notions about G.A. that it would be full of old men all talking about how much they would love to have a bet or preaching to me about God and trying to convert me to go to church, Yes, there are some old men but apart from that it‚Äôs not how I imagined it would be. I‚Äôve a blog titled ‚ÄúWhy Do I Go To G.A.‚Äù which explains it in further detail but in summary it is a place I can go where I will not be judged, where I will be understood, where I will be supported through the bad times and where the good times will be celebrated. It‚Äôs a place I can dump my shit on the floor (not literally) and where I can listen and learn from others. It is a simple program for complicated people. I have yet to meet someone who has been attending meetings regularly that has relapsed since I have been in G.A. There have been people who stop going to meetings that relapse but if you attend regularly, from what I have seen with my own eyes, it will help keep you off a bet. Once in G.A. you can find a sponsor and work the steps which I have found to be extremely helpful.
5. Other Therapies ‚Äì This could be counselling or CBT etc. but what I am I member of is the Problem Gambling Support Group which has it‚Äôs own WhatsApp chat group and runs three meetings a week via Skype. I have met some great people in that group and we are all striving to recover from this. It is a small group but we have people from all over the world who attend and it is something I look forward to every week. Even just having a group there that I could reach out to if I was struggling is invaluable.
6. Reddit Problem Gambling Sub ‚Äì This is where I found the Problem Gambling Support Group but the Sub itself is a great place to post how I am dealing with my recovery and it also gives me an opportunity to reach out to people who are struggling and try to support them through it. It‚Äôs very much a community that tries to help each other on a daily basis and I try to check in and either post or comment a few times a day.
7. Writing ‚Äì I have been writing my blog since entering recovery and I have found it gives me the opportunity to dig deep and really reflect on what emotions I was feeling when I was gambling and gives me a platform to potentially reach out to others. I write from a purely selfish point of view if I am being honest, it helps me. I get so much out of it and just being able to get my thoughts and feelings into words is a healthy process for me. If the blog helps others that‚Äôs an added bonus for me.
8. Twitter ‚Äì There are a lot of people on twitter who can offer excellent advice when it comes to recovery and it is a great place to see blogs and vlogs from various folk who are putting the time and effort in to reach out to others. It‚Äôs a great tool to have during recovery but for me it would not be a replacement for G.A.
9. Podcasts/Audio Books ‚Äì I listen to as many things about addiction and recovery as I can. All In: Addicted Gamblers Podcast, After Gambling Podcast, Podcast Recovery are my weekly listens.
10. Acceptance ‚Äì This is probably one of the most important things I have found in the early stages of recovery. I have accepted I can no longer gamble and I have accepted that I can never gamble again. I have also accepted that this journey is for life and I just have to take it one day at a time. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference.

These are the things that have helped me during the early stages of recovery. I have not had an urges, although they could strike at anytime, and I feel in such a better place than I was on April 2nd 2019. My own opinion is that recovery is much more than just stopping gambling and paying off debt, those are the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù parts. Recovery to me is about becoming a better person, a better partner, a better Dad, a better son and a better friend. It will take time, it‚Äôs a journey for life and I have fully embraced that. Right now gambling isn‚Äôt even on my list of how I would deal with a problem should it arise, but I cannot become complacent.

For anyone reading this who is struggling with giving up or relapsing I will leave you with a quote I seen early on in my recovery and it stuck with me.

‚ÄúAt some point there is NO EXCUSE. Either you want to do EVERYTHING it takes to MAKE it happen or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

839,1,"Suggested reading: The Power of HabitForgive me for preaching here but I just finished up this book, 'The Power of Habit' and it was truly awesome. Specifically, because there's a story about a ""problem gambler"". It's in chapter 9 and I highly suggest reading that chapter in particular if you are open to it.  

On another note, reading or listening to audiobooks has helped me a ton these last 52 days. Another great book is ""Unfu\*k yourself"". 

Audiobooks allow me to take notes and absorb the information so I can review it after and always revisit it if I need to. 

Cheers,

840,1,"Day 34 and my commuteI‚Äôve been on the same commute this week for work and I pass a giant lotto billboard on the way to work and then another giant casino billboard on the way back home. What a joke. The casino billboard is for the one I excluded myself from. It angers me because of the two time daily reminder of the horrific financial mess compulsive gambling has caused me and the tiny response that‚Äôs still there in the back of my mind when I see big jackpot numbers thinking that could be me, I could still win it all back and then some. I wish that part would finally go away. I hate that it‚Äôs still there and it catches me by surprise that a part of me STILL wants to gamble after everything I‚Äôve educated myself on and knowing I‚Äôll never win. The anger, however,  keeps my regret fresh even after over a month gamble-free. I want to feel angry. My sobriety feeds off of it. Normalizing my losses and numbing my devastating losses in order to keep gambling is what got me into this mess in the first place.

851,1,"My TherapyAt my most recent Problem Gambling Support Group meeting via Skype (the same one posted on here weekly) it was my turn to do a therapy session. This is my journey from starting gambling until now. I thought it would be worth sharing here as someone may get something from it. It is a bit of a long read.

My name is Mark and i‚Äôm a compulsive gambler. My last bet was April 2nd 2019. The day of April 2nd was a massive turning point in my life, it was the day I finally admitted to my long term partner, who is the mother of my two children, and to my parents that I was a compulsive gambler and needed help. The weekend prior was when I finally said to myself I‚Äôve had enough, I had been betting for 14 years and it had beaten me so badly that I was a mess mentally and financially. Although no one knew that because I was an expert at hiding it.

I started gambling like almost anyone in the UK or Ireland, The Grand National. The one day of the year where it seems like every man, woman and child has a bet on. The biggest horse race in the world. That and those glorious holidays spent in Portrush playing the 2p machines (penny fall machines). I don‚Äôt for one second blame those experiences for my gambling problem, they are just my first memories of gambling. One really vivid memory I have of gambling was when I was begging my dad for the latest Official Playstation Magazine, the one with the demo disc, and he was just sitting down to watch England play against someone and said to me ‚Äúif Paul Scholes scores the first goal I will get you the magazine.‚Äù Now, I know for a fact win or lose my Dad would have gotten me the magazine, he just said that so I would give him peace to watch the match. Well I remember watching the game with him hoping with all my might Paul Scholes would score 1st and he did. That adrenaline rush, even at a young age (I was 13 years old at most I would say) was unbelievable. Now, again, I am not blaming that for my gambling addiction at all, it is just one of my first vivid memories but that mentality of gambling to get something I want for free would be a regular pattern throughout my gambling career. 

Once I turned 18 I opened my first betting account with Blue Sq and that started my online sports gambling journey. Friday nights were spent betting on Wolverhampton all weather horse racing and the Dutch and French 2nd Divisions. All harmless fun, controlled gambling, small stakes. I was still working part time at this stage, left school that summer and gambling was not in the way. Once I got my full time job though that all changed.

The first time I could put my finger on when my gambling changed was the first day of the 2008/2009 football season. I‚Äôd been working full time for about 3 years and my gambling was still under control, well, at least I thought it was. My stakes were still low and I was doing football bets at the weekend for a bit of fun. I gambled, but it wasn‚Äôt causing me any issues. That Friday I walked into a Paddy Power and decided instead of placing a load of stupid football bets for ¬£1 or ¬£2 I‚Äôd pick three teams for the season and do a ¬£20 treble each week. Sheffield United, Leicester City and Leeds United were the picks. Of course, the first weekend it landed (the only time it landed all season I think) and my betting changed from that moment. I genuinely can‚Äôt remember the odds but I must have lifted over ¬£100 from that ¬£20 stake and after that staking ¬£1 or ¬£2 just wasn‚Äôt appealing. What was the point in that when I could stake ¬£20 and win more. From that moment my gambling started to get out of control over time. Then came the loans, the credit cards and the payday loans.

At some point around this time I had opened a spread betting account due to a sign up offer. Now I did not have the first clue about spread betting but the offer was they gave you a free ¬£100 or something to sign up so I did. I was still living at home at the time and we had one computer which everyone used. Well my Dad stumbled upon this website and was able to access the account (he‚Äôs not technically minded so I imagine I left it logged in) and he seen the betting history and he went mental at me. Now, I did explain that it was just bonus funds and I hadn‚Äôt actually deposited any of my own money but still the lecture came. It felt like a lecture at the time to me but he was just warning me of the dangers of gambling. Giving me examples of people he knew who had a problem and how easy it is for a gambling problem to begin. So I can never turn around and say that I wasn‚Äôt aware of the dangers, I was, my ego was just too big to listen. I paid lip service to the lecture and said I wouldn‚Äôt do it again and my Dad took me at my word and trusted me. 

So, I knew early on I had a problem. I self excluded from places over the years but never really wanted to quit. I was getting in debt but was able to continue with my lifestyle as I was living at home. I remember one day going to a cheque cashing place where I could write a cheque for ¬£100, dated on my next payday, and they‚Äôd give me ¬£90 there and then. I did two cheques for going out that weekend (and a couple of bets on the Aintree Festival) walked straight to the bookies and had the ¬£180 on Denman to win the Aintree Bowl at even money. Denman was a monster of a horse, a machine. He could not lose...then he suffered the first fall of his career. Back I went to the cheque cashing place for another ¬£90 so I could still go out that weekend. 

I wasn‚Äôt learning from my betting mistakes either as I was just borrowing more money to cover the cracks. I got a few debt consolidating loans over the early years to try and get a handle on my debt but it just gave me an excuse to take out more credit. The payday loans which I used to either gamble or cover my expenses for going out because I used all my money gambling. I would borrow money off my Dad and give him the puppy dog eyes when I paid it back and normally he‚Äôd only take half of what I owed him. He thought he was doing the right thing and he wanted me to have money to be able to go out with friends, I was just manipulating the situation.

I moved out and into my friends house for a year and the gambling continued, although I had less money to gamble with. My credit rating was taking a battering but I was young and didn‚Äôt really care. Then I met my current girlfriend in February 2010 and we moved in together that September. The gambling continued and was getting worse. I made the smart move to get a second job to supplement my gambling‚Ä¶...at a greyhound track. I‚Äôd be earning about ¬£20 a night but gambling ¬£60 or ¬£80. Insanity. We had our first child in April 2012 and not long after she found out I‚Äôd be gambling some of the money we‚Äôd saved. It wasn‚Äôt a lot of money, but she was pissed (rightfully so). I managed to talk my way out of it and that was when I became really good at hiding things. She took control of the rent money and any money for our son so that was never in danger thankfully. We had our daughter in 2016 but the gambling still continued.

It may seem like I have glossed over an important period of time there but the truth is I can‚Äôt really remember any of the details. The only details I am able to recall with any great clarity are coming up but I just want to touch on a couple of things from this period. This was a time when I had the biggest wins of my gambling career, two separate occasions. One was an insane run of luck where I couldn‚Äôt lose all weekend and ended up with enough money for me, my partner and our Son to have our first and only foreign holiday. Another time I had a ¬£5 free bet and landed a treble at Sandown, all Gary Moore horses and won ¬£3.5k. That money went towards decorating the nursery for my soon to be born Daughter, my partner got money, my Mum and Dad and her Mum and Dad. I bought a PS4 and gambled the rest from memory. The two reasons these moments stick in my head isn‚Äôt just the amounts, it‚Äôs the only time I walked away in profit, at least for the sessions in question and the reason is that I told my partner I had won the money. That was the only way I knew I wouldn‚Äôt gamble it all away because she would ask questions if the money I promised didn‚Äôt materialise. 

Another part of this time period I want to explore is how I was emotionally. I was 25 when we had our Son and he wasn‚Äôt planned. It was a shock to say the least and my life, as I knew it anyways, changed. No longer was I able to do what I wanted socially, I had a Son to provide for. I was working two jobs, money was tight, was I still gambling? Of course I was but slowly I started to strip everything else out of my life. We had our daughter when I was 29 and to be honest here, as much as it sadeness me I thought this way I resented having kids, especially at that age. I felt trapped at times, people I knew were able to do what they want but yet I had all this responsibility. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I loved my kids during this time as well and they meant the world to me, but I do feel that I got into the thought process that I was trapped because of them and my only escape was into the world of online gambling.

I would go through phases where I‚Äôd stop altogether for months on end, a year at one point which I imagine was around the time my partner found out about me using the savings for gambling, but I‚Äôd always go back to it thinking I was in control but I never was. When gambling I‚Äôd deposit ¬£10, lose it, deposit another ¬£10, lose it, rinse and repeat until all my money was gone. If I won it just meant I could gamble longer. It was never about the money. I thought it was, but really the money was the fuel that could keep me gambling longer. Most months I was skint a few days after payday and couldn‚Äôt gamble until the next payday. It may not sound like a lot of money but it was a relentless cycle month after month after month.

At the end of 2016 I got an overdraft of ¬£2k and gambled it all on soccer all around the world. Woke up and started gambling in Asia, moved across the globe into the Middle East, Africa, Europe and then fell asleep betting on South American football. It was out of control. Betting on Egyptian football on Xmas Day a particular lowlight. This was what my gambling looked like when I had money. All these bets were in-play as that‚Äôs how I gambled, watching a little graphic on Bet365 and thinking I could predict what was going to happen. I also gambled heavily on tennis as well, picking a player to win a set 6-0 was one of my favourites. Generally I would start with ¬£10 as I mentioned and if the bet won I would keep ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù all the money until it got to a certain amount, normally a couple of hundred quid. Once I got to that point I would raise my stakes significantly because I would tell myself it wasn‚Äôt my money. It wasn‚Äôt if I didn‚Äôt count all the loses it took to get to this point over the previous few days. I would then gamble that until it‚Äôs gone cursing myself for not taking the money when I had the chance. Placing the last of my money praying to a god I don‚Äôt believe in that if he could just make this bet land then I wouldn‚Äôt bet again. Once the money was done I would just sit there, looking at my bank balance, the lack of money, the direct debits due to come out in a few days, trying to figure out how I would survive the next 3-4 weeks until payday. Then I would dust myself off and start working on some budgets. What direct debits I could bounce, who I could ask to borrow money from or maybe what I could sell to fund another round of gambling to try and win my money back.

Coming into 2018 I was in a ‚Äúgood place‚Äù with gambling, or so I thought. I was Matched Betting which was a way of making money via bookmakers offers. It worked well for a few months but it all went to shit in the Summer of 2018. Matched Betting introduced me to the casino side of things and I lost ¬£3.5k on roulette. I‚Äôll not go into the ins and outs of how I had that sort of money, lets just say I didn‚Äôt and I found a way to deposit via direct debit on PayPal and of course those all bounced. Luckily Paddy Power rewarded me by making me a VIP customer after that, every cloud and all that. So I was chasing big style and getting free ¬£50 bonuses each week from them but I could never get enough money to stop, because no amount was ever going to be enough. Their offers of Money Back if Horse X wins are normally ¬£10 max refund, I was getting ¬£100 max refund. Eventually I was running out of ways to get money and when I started to bet less with Paddy Power they removed my VIP status. I did win ¬£1000 on an NFL bet and lost the lot on roulette the next week. Another lowlight. 

The win on the NFL followed by the lose on roulette sticks in my mind because visually it summed up how miserable I was. I had promised my partner back at the start of the year that we would get the living room redecorated and I would pay with it from my Matched Betting and she was happy with that. Of course I explained it was risk free and nothing could go wrong and it wasn‚Äôt even gambling. Anyways, come November we are due to have our living room redecorated and of course I do not have the money for it so I have to go to my Mum and Dad. I give them some sob story about how when I was Matched Betting I made a mistake, layed off the wrong horse and lost my money so could then lend me it and don‚Äôt tell my partner. It was a complete lie and to be honest at the time I didn‚Äôt think they had bought it but they lent me the money. Turns out when I told them about my gambling problem back in April they had smelt bull shit but my Granda (on my Dad‚Äôs side) was ill in the hospital and he was stressed about that so he just let it slide. So the redecoration was on and it was going to take a couple of days. One Monday night I had a bet on the NFL and it landed, ¬£10 at 100/1. Happy days, I can give my Mum and Dad back their money, it‚Äôs nearly Xmas, this is amazing luck. So on Tuesday night I sat in my half decorated living room and thought if I could just win a little bit more then things would be even better so loaded up the roulette. I lost it all sitting in the living room and during it I could literally see what the money would be paying for but it didn‚Äôt stop me, nothing would stop me.

2019 I could feel myself struggling. My life was consumed with gambling or working out how to get money to gamble and then how I was going to pay people back what I owed them. I was in a bad place, I was a bad person, lying, angry but still no one knew the truth. January had always been a tough month as I run several NFL Fantasy Football leagues for money and I am in charge of the money. Of course, that was always gambled away by me and January was the month people expected pay outs because the season was over. Usually I would have won enough money in my leagues to cover it or convince people to pay for next year with their winnings that I could cover it. This year I could not and I had the added pressure of owing people money. A lot of these people were friends of mine I knew personally, others were people I had gotten to know over a few years and only talked online. Either way I had stolen their money and gambled it away. I managed to use my Granda‚Äôs death in January as an excuse for why I had not paid people yet, I was in a bad way with the funeral etc, all the excuses, the truth is I was just trying to buy more time. 

Then came the weekend prior to April 2nd. I had just been paid and deposited some money into my Bet365 account and managed to get my balance up to ¬£910 on Friday 29th March. I should say by this stage I was fully gambling on tennis. Not match winner, that took too long, generally set winner or next game winner as that was quicker. Now this ¬£910 would have cleared some of my urgent debts to allow me to continue on gambling. All I had to do was withdraw, and I was going to‚Ä¶...once I got it up to a nice round ¬£1000. As you can guess I lost the lot. ¬£300-¬£400 on Benoit Paire was one of the worst hits but I was gambling like a mad man. That was how I bet when I had winnings, the stakes got out of control. By the time I was leaving work at 6pm on the Friday the whole ¬£910 was gone. I was betting on ATP, Challenger, ITF, any tennis that was on I was betting on it. Back in the day I remember betting on a tennis match where they had one ball. Still a story that brings a smile to my face if I‚Äôm honest. A smile that consists of a mixture of shame and cringe. That Friday night I deposited whatever I had left in and managed to win back a good chunk of the money, but it still wasn‚Äôt enough. It still wasn‚Äôt what I had before. So the whole weekend went like that, up and down, up and down. I went to a family dinner and sat betting on my phone the whole night. That‚Äôs how my life has been the last number of years, i‚Äôm present at gatherings, or nights out but my mind is deep in my phone gambling away not giving a shit about anyone.

Eventually the money ran out that weekend. I was a mess. I could have actually made it work financially and gotten through the month but mentally I was gone. I could tell my brain had put me into a nosedive and the only way this was all ending was in disaster. Maybe not this month, or this year but I was being flown towards rock bottom.

I sat down on the Monday and wrote out everything that I owed, who I owed it to, a budget going forward. It was grim enough reading, ¬£18k in the hole. The money wasn‚Äôt the issue, it was how it was making me feel, the time I‚Äôve been wasting. The fact that I finally couldn‚Äôt take anymore, that I was ready to wave the white flag and say gambling has won, it defeated me. I found out when and where the nearest GA Meeting was to me and wrote that down too. So I found a set of balls and on the Tuesday I told my girlfriend. My attitude was that life can‚Äôt be any worse for me than it currently is. I was a mess, I cried, I honestly expected her to tell me to get out and I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed her, but she was amazing. She was angry obviously, but she was so supportive. Then I called my parents round and told them. They were disappointed, confused but also really supportive. Then the next day I told my closest friends who were again all really supportive. I owe them some money too and they‚Äôve been great about setting up a payment plan to pay that back. I can imagine some people saying that I didn‚Äôt hit rock bottom in comparison to others, I felt that way myself to be honest. I felt like I had gotten off lightly but looking back the cycle I was in was soul destroying and although I didn‚Äôt cause the devastation others have caused I knew I needed to reach out for help as I couldn‚Äôt do it on my own. 

I registered for GAMStop and self excluded online for 5 years which has taken the avenue of online gambling away from me. A vital step if online is your vice. I also handed over control of my finances to my partner which again removed another temptation. I‚Äôve since learned in recovery that gamblers need 3 things, time, opportunity and money, take away one of those and you won‚Äôt be able to gamble. I took away two with these simple steps.

I then went to my first GA Meeting on Wednesday 3rd April. The time doesn‚Äôt suit me for that, Monday at 9pm is my meeting but I felt I needed to get to one ASAP. I don‚Äôt know what I expected GA to be, some sort of church run cult filled with a bunch of old men desperate for a bet but it‚Äôs one of the most amazing groups I‚Äôve ever found. It‚Äôs a dumping ground for all my shit and it‚Äôs a place where I can listen to other people‚Äôs stories. Without sounding sexist, it‚Äôs something a lot of men could do with outside of addiction, a place to talk about life and how they are feeling. I take a 50 mile round trip every Monday to get there. When I was gambling if I had to travel 50 miles to get internet to gamble you can guarantee I‚Äôd have travelled every day. When I leave a meeting I am buzzing, for all the right reasons. I‚Äôm a lifer when it comes to GA now and I am fine with that.

I am also a member of the Problem Gambling Support Group and we run three meetings a week via Skype. This group has been so influential to my recovery and I have met so many good people I now consider friends through it. The topic meeting style is completely different to what happens at my own GA so it fits into my recovery perfectly and gives me a different perspective.

I have a sponsor, who has had a massive impact on my recovery. He has helped me work the Steps and is always there if I need him. At times it‚Äôs hard to tell who is sponsoring who but that sort of dynamic works well for me as I see him as a friend first and sponsor/sponsee second.

I have also found a passion for writing about my journey and post my stuff on my blog, on GamCare and on the Reddit Problem Gambling Sub. I have been told my stuff is very good and people seem to get a lot from it. As I explained at a recent meeting I am still learning how to deal with praise, it makes me feel awkward. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs from years of not wanting to be the focus of people's attention because of the fear they might ask questions and my addiction would be exposed. Whatever the reason I am working on being able to accept praise and enjoy it and as I was told at the last meeting...a simple thank you is usually enough. 

I‚Äôve been clean for over 9 months now, and I have not struggled with urges to gamble. My life is amazing, it always was but I was too wrapped up in my addiction to notice. I literally had everything I could ever want. I have an amazing partner and two amazing children along with my parents who are absolutely fantastic. I have my health, a job and my friends are another support network I couldn‚Äôt do without now. They stood by me when I admitted my problem and they gave me the belief that I could do this.

Recovery is now my focus along with my family. The debt can be managed, stopping gambling is one day at a time, but the main focus of my recovery will be fixing my character defects, helping others, being open and honest to people and not being a selfish asshole. I would like to think those that know me now can at least drop the selfish part when describing me. 

I have put plenty of work into my recovery and I feel like I am getting the benefits out of it. I have a routine when it comes to meetings and they don‚Äôt impact on my family life. Is every day amazing? No it‚Äôs not. Some days are rather boring and some days are tough, but that‚Äôs life. Some days you have to make chicken salad out of chicken shit. I have accepted what I am, I am a compulsive gambler and I need to be the one who changes. No one else around me needs to change, I am the common denominator. I have noticed a change in myself and those closest to me. They all seem happier, more content, happy to have this me in their life and not the old me. I wasn‚Äôt a nice partner, father, son or friend when I was in active addiction. I don‚Äôt want to be the person I was before I started gambling either because I am pretty convinced he was an asshole as well. I am using this recovery to become the man I want to be, the man I can look in the mirror and be proud to be. 

As I said, I have accepted that I am a compulsive gambler and I cannot have a single bet because it will lead me back to active addiction. I have no issues with the gambling industry or people who gamble, I just know that I am unable to gamble as it ends in disaster. I feel there should be more discussion around problem gambling and the industry should be putting more money into helping problem gamblers and to help identify problem gamblers. It‚Äôs a fine line though, as I know if a bookie told me they felt I had a problem and wouldn‚Äôt accept a bet I‚Äôd have been angry and just went somewhere else. You need to be ready for recovery to fully embrace it. I never was until April 2nd. For the people in recovery we need to be ready to help those that get to the stage where they are ready for recovery. We are the ones who these people will come to rely on as we‚Äôve been through it, you can tell when talking to someone who hasn‚Äôt had a gambling addiction they just don‚Äôt understand. Over the coming years I think there will be a significant rise in people looking for help with problem gambling. I don‚Äôt feel like my story is close to the worst out there and I have read and heard some people who have the opinion that you need to cause devastation before recovery will work. That‚Äôs bollocks and that sort of attitude is why GA is filled with old men and young people are reluctant to stay. I have come to believe it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you have lost, how many relationships you have destroyed or what age you are, all you need is a desire to stop gambling and that is the qualification for entering recovery.

For now though, for me, my next bet won‚Äôt be about the money I lose, I‚Äôll lose my partner and my children as well and that‚Äôs not a bet that I am not willing to make.

852,1,"So I've fallen back to where i started but it doesnt end thereSince my last post on quitting, I've  went back 3 times over the spand of 10 days. Over these ten days though, i got really introspective of myself. I started focusing on my other addictions like porn and food. I've been on this thing called no fap for 9 days so far without porn. I also went on a full plant based vegan diet for 8 days now and just started exercising too. I've been having so much energy to accomplish more things. Im bringing more positivity to my life now. Having a more positive life to fall back on is a great foundation to quit gambling. I have to say i am proud of myself even though i continued to go out. I didnt compulsively problem gamble this time. I spent what i brought and went home. Then i won a lil more than i brought and took my winnings and didn't just put it all back. And then i lost like $40 but nomore than that. I also ate a free buffet and they actually had vegan food. I didnt overeat 10 pounds of meat. But anyways, will i ever quit this social outing that i have with my parents? Or hopefully cut down to like 2-3 times a months instead of 11 times or more. A little risk is fun, but when it becomes a problem and it affects mental health, that's when i know to stop and have discipline."

Busy is a lot better for my gambling sobriety though and here I am at the end of Day 33 üéâ I‚Äôm sitting here going through the file cabinet of my mind searching for a meaningful gambling regret to reflect upon and the one that jumped out at me today was the time I cried in my car all the way home.

864,1,"Day 22 - Reflecting dailySo ... I became soooo detached from my money, like it was Monopoly money and not my life savings. I can recall times when I was ‚Äúnot‚Äù frenzied in a casino and was very casual and I just kept saying F*** it, I‚Äôve lost this much what‚Äôs another hundred or worse thousand at this point since I‚Äôm screwed anyway. 

As I watched my bank acct balances dwindle I just felt detached! Just numbness. I‚Äôm looking into learning more about money itself and want to explore my relationship to money. ‚ÄúNOTHING‚Äù to do with my gambling illness but I know there‚Äôs a deficit there with me too, how I see money itself. Probably something to do with my childhood isn‚Äôt it always that lol.. ughhh ..  back to the therapist I go. Not so funny I know. But how I value money is something I would definitely like to explore. I‚Äôve even been afraid when I‚Äôve had large amounts of money (like after selling a home) and thought, well what do I DO with all this money. Uhhh. Nothing! Let it sit and grow in your savings for God‚Äôs sake!! Or invest! Talk to a financial planner! Nope nope, did none of that. And off to the casino I would go. Sigh. 

I‚Äôm working hard on facing my illness and understanding that I CANNOT place one bet. No urges yet for me not one. So done with gambling. However, I AM NOT to be trusted in front of a slot machine this much I know. Let‚Äôs just try to make it each day folks. Soon they start to add up. Wishing you all the absolute best."

876,1,"That's it ... I'm done!!!Hi everyone:  I've been lurking for a while, looking for a new community to join.  I belonged to another gambling recovery online group but I find that the forum is too quiet.  So, I'm here to try this one.

My back story:  Discovered casinos (slots) when I was in my early thirties.  For about 10 years, I was fine, didn't go much because they were about a two hour drive away.  Then, of course, they came to my neighborhood in 2006 and I lost the plot!  Around 2008, I self-excluded from all casinos in my province for about six months.  That slowed things down for a bit.  Also in 2008, there was the financial  crisis!!!!  I had a small business and so did my husband and we were hit HARD.  I had a nice big home, kids in private school, lots of work and then BAM!! Nothing.  Had to downsize to a smaller house and REALLY change my lifestyle.  In the years that followed, I worked various long-term contracts, but I've had too many gaps and money has become a big issue between my husband and I.

I am extremely resentful of the ugly turn my life has taken and use that as an excuse to gamble.  The last three years have been hell.  I haven't worked in that time and I am desperate.  The problem is, I now face ageism.  My husband is a contractor and work slows during the winter, so it's a scary time.  So, what do I do?  I sneak out and gamble ... like an idiot!!

Since 2008 I have had only one six month gambling free period and two four month periods.  I HAVE to stop.  I know this.  But I find it hard to WANT to stop.  I realize that this is the key to a gambling free life.

I am really frustrated with myself.  I have done everything ... read all the books, including Alan Carr, listened to podcasts, watched videos on gambling recovery, read horror stories to keep myself in line, gone to one-on-one therapy and group therapy.  You name it, I've done it.  Am I really just a hopeless case junkie?  

Tonight, I went and lost money we don't have.  I don't take out loans or use credit cards to gamble.  I (mostly) go without my debit card and I'm fairly limited in the amount I can take.  Still, I lost most of my money, then won back then initial amount, then doubled the amount and more, but as usual, I could not walk out.  So, I'm done.  I have to be.  I'm going to write on this forum most days and set up a habit tracker in my planner so that I can see my progress each day.  I started the year well, but fell in Week 3.  Now, I'm ready to make a permanent change.  Let's take charge of this decade!!!"

I'm literally incapable of gambling anymore and I'm so glad this self-exclusion possibility exists in the first place.

Good luck to you all!"

899,1,"Anyone else not having anything to replace gambling with? (long post)Hi, I just discovered this sub, so it's my first post here.

I'm at this point (since years already I guess) where I only spend money on (some) food and gambling. Several of you may be familiar with this behavior. I have emotional issues which relates to this, but that's another story. The thing I wanna talk about, is that I have absolutely nothing to replace gambling with, even if I would try. I isolated myself, have no people to go out with, as I don't even feel like doing it, I am alone and it seems there's no woman to like me anyway, I have no hobbies to spend money on, as gaming, movies and reading are more or less free, therefore I have absolutely nothing to put in place. I hope some of you get me (not that I hope you're in the same situation).

I believe that people in a relationship/married, and the ones with friends or family around them, are really lucky and can easily find motivation and support in their fight with the addiction. It's not easy per se in any way, but it's definitely easier than being alone and pretty much hopeless for a better future.

At this point I'm not even sure I want to give up gambling. Yes, it ruins my mood, it ruins my finances, as I already have a very low salary, it obviously harms my life, but at the same time, the thrill of betting and the fact I have something to occupy my mind with, gives me some kind of purpose, even if it's nonsense in a way.

When I'm betting, I feel like I did something for that day, to say so. It's a short term purpose in life. Does anyone relate to this?

I'm not good looking at all, on the contrary, so ""finding someone"" is a bit problematic to say the least, I have no real career (just a casual job), nor an apartment or some sort of money put aside, so it's basically just the hopeless and isolated me, in the company of myself.

Are there people in here who found themselves in a somewhat similar situation? As in not feeling any purpose in life, not believing in a better future, and at the same time not finding any reason to quit gambling?

I believe this addiction issues come from deep emotional ones, and that's the way it is to everyone. I am pretty messed up on the inside, but maybe some of you were too and you still found hope, I don't know. Anyway, this sub is like a group therapy, from what I can tell, therefore I wanted to share this with you and hear some opinions or something.

Whoever reads this, thanks. And just for the record, I'm not a native English speaker.

P.S: I've bet all the money I had left tonight (which was very little), lost (ofc), but I still don't feel like I could've done anything better with them. And the next payment comes soon, and I'm afraid I'm gonna bet it all again, as I can't find any f*cking reason why wouldn't I..."

One huge problem to the gamblers compulsive nature is they simply do not accept defeat and walk away. This is my case tonight. During the heat of the moment, I ask myself ""I lost good chunk of money just now, how can I not be mad and calmly walk away?""

This has to stop tho, I really really hate my life in its current state. I have to stop gambling, not just for a while but completely. Today has to be day 0.

Hope I still have somewhere to go home to..."
921,1,"Getting over losses mentallyI was recently ¬£30-35k ish in debt after saving a bit from previous gambling debt - 40 ish k. On New years eve and new years day, I had a significant win for the first time. I got it up to ¬£17k, then ¬£22k then ""30k from ¬£1k in. I then went to collect but had the usual delays with pending withdrawals, asking for verification and then said they could only pay amount each week (but we'll look into it cos you're a VIP... sad).

I got too drunk one night and eventually caved and reversed all the withdrawals. Gutted. What a fucking idiot. All debts paid off, 2 years saving and that's while living with my parents.

A few days after I had another run. ¬£2k to ¬£18k.  This would've allowed me at least to move out back to my old town. After moving back in with my parents at age 35, this is what I've been wanting to do for 2 years. Specifically out of this town and this job. However, same story, pending withdrawals, week long delays, more verification with unknown timescales. Again, while drinking I did it all in two seperate sessions. And then another ¬£4k. I've also recently had a debit of 2000 ish come out of my account from 12 days ago, something I wasn't aware of which has pushed me 2000 past my overdraft limit of 5000. I now have to plead with the bank to give me a temp increase or divert my payday (this friday) funds to some other bank account otherwise I won't be able to get to work, food or make any other direct debits for loans and other stuff for 5 weeks. I've never had any other big wins before or since, it was just blind luck and gambling recklessly.

But how do you deal with this mentally if all you do is work some job in a town you don't want to be in as a single 37 year old man living with parents? Paying off this debt is slow... it's going to take another year of this to pay off maybe 13-16k - not sure haven't done the exact calculations - if you factor interest in. I might call them up and ask (you can only try) for interest freezing. I could've been out of here. If the money went to my account without all this bullshit dithering and dathering I could've at least paid off some loans and cards. I can't get any more, my credit is shot. So it would just be my own money that I'd be blowing gambling if I didn't cut it out.

If you have nothing going on, no house, no dating (for 14 years), no hobbies (tried) and work a 10-11 hour day with commute how do you get out of bed. You're essentially adjusting a digit on a server somewhere, albeit all due to your own stupidity. I can't drive (...) so any other jobs would be local and they're few and far between. In fact this job pays less per hour in real terms than my first office job I got at age 23 did and it's just as annoying. Great progress. For a fool. Another thing is one of the loans is in my parents' name, so I can't even jump off a bridge cos they;d be liable for it.

Also, I'm running the risk of a financial check on my background due to a government pass needed to work for my employer. I don't work for MI6 or anything interesting, it goes for everyone at the company. If I fail then, then it really is over. I got involved in THAT because someone overheard me saying I lost on gambling the other day and reported it to the boss. I passed it last time, but that was with lesser debt and no default.

How to deal with it though, knowing that you've thrown another 1-2 years of your life away. Before I even started gambling pre 2018 I knew I had to do something before I reached middle age proper. No relationships, no savings, hadn't really done much."
922,1,"68 days and new week begins!Wow that flew! The weekends always concern me a little. I may have no urges anymore, but what if they rear their ugly head like they‚Äôve done countless times before. Always have messed up on a weekend!

But this weekend gone, I did so much stuff at home that there are blisters on my feet from walking and standing so much. Resisted having my nanny naps during the day so the momentum wouldn‚Äôt be broken. Back to work today and know I‚Äôm safe from gambling for another 5 days. Hope everyone is doing well &amp;amp; keeping up the fight. I‚Äôve got this far despite having lots of free time and being bored a lot. I‚Äôve learnt that boredom is far better than the gutted feeling of fucking up again &amp;amp; having less. 

These days we have so much entertainment to distract us such as Netflix and Disney channel, for relaxing and zoning out. But if it‚Äôs action you want, do it, or u can google whatever you please. Think of something you enjoy and google classes, or diy, or maybe you want to eat healthier.. look up some new recipes and spend the day cooking. You can even cook a large batch and freeze it so food is done for the whole week, more time to do the things you want in the week, &amp;amp; you will feel good! The possibilities are endless! In the early days of quitting, I always struggled for motivation. The world looks dark, I hate myself, I think of where I could have been if I wasn‚Äôt so stupid/addicted. But soon enough that feeling is behind us, don‚Äôt give in &amp;amp; just deal with the bad feelings. They only feel bad because of the monster in our heads.

 There is simply no good reason to gamble. All the best to us all!"

925,1,"Day 19 ..Drinking + Gambling = Destruction in my world.  12 years of that madness. After years of my same ole routine I always began a gambling evening thinking it would all be mild and fine. I anticipated the enjoyment of relaxing, having a few cocktails and just gambling for a while the few hundred I would take. I wanted to win of course and always figured I would as I started out at the casino. Next thing I know ... (big sigh) I‚Äôm asking a gambling neighbor to hold down the fort (my machine) while I run to the ATM for more cash. Then I‚Äôm flagging down cocktail servers one after the other. Somewhere in there I‚Äôm needing my machine held while I dash to the bathroom, next to the cashier window as I‚Äôve now reached my ATM debit limit. I never used my credit cards but found I could use my debit card as a credit card at the cashier and it seems to have no limits. Thousands would pour out of my account in one evening at the height of my illness. It was sad. I knew in the moment I was in a frenzied, alcohol fueled state and I didn‚Äôt care one bit. Yes it was stressful but I wanted to win. That was it. That is ALL I cared about. Wow. So since none of that is logical or reasonable and it‚Äôs extraordinarily self-destructive gambling in that manner must be a sickness. Well .. IT IS. And I have it. 

These 19 days have been the calmest, most relaxing and normal days I‚Äôve had in the longest. In fact I‚Äôm  finding the stability and steadiness addictive. I want more and more of this peace of mind, of owning what has been going on ... my raging gambling illness ... and having savings accounts that suddenly have steady balances and no activity. I take this day by day and I actively work on ME. My mental health. I‚Äôm more and more clear-headed with each passing day too. Remarkably, no urges. I know without a doubt I CAN NOT GAMBLE. I am not to be trusted once I sit down at a machine. Not to worry, I won‚Äôt be there. I‚Äôve got other things to do. Yay!"

934,1,"MY STORY, lost over $100K..*ACCEPTANCE*Hello there everyone - I was messaging with another member here about that feeling of being afraid and not trusting yourself AT ALL as it relates to gambling and that it‚Äôs a terrible feeling. I realized as I wrote to that member that I needed to just share my story in general, I haven‚Äôt done that yet, I had not ‚Äúcome out‚Äù shall we say. I learned from my grief group (lost my spouse in 2015) that telling your story over and over is critical to healing. 

I‚Äôve been gambling for 12 years up until New Years Day 2020 and I‚Äôve lost over $100,000. I have ALWAYS thought I had a problem. I could tell. I sat down at a quarter machine in 2007 and promptly won $3000. It was a holiday and the casino was jam packed. I just sat down where I could find a spot. Everyone was gambling furiously and when I won after just a few spins the entire row of people just dead-panned me, they looked irritated. I get it now. Now that I‚Äôve lost so much and spent hours and hours at one machine. When you‚Äôre a hardcore (aka addicted) gambler, there‚Äôs so much at stake when you‚Äôre gambling hard like that. I‚Äôve decided there are stages in our gambling. 

Anyway, I was hooked from that day on. Winning was THRILLING and seemed so easy. Fun turned into hey ok I‚Äôll go to the casino out of boredom, to celebrate and on and on but the whole time I could see I was way too into it. Eventually it was my escape place. I felt those stages and most definitely knew I was addicted all these years, never once did I think I was a normal gambler. At some point I ordered a bunch of literature and a few books from GA which I read faithfully daily, my gambling decreased but never stopped. Then a few years ago I walked into a GA meeting, did several of those and stopped going.  They didn‚Äôt quite resonate with me and I did not want to stop gambling plain and simple. 

Finally I called my CPA last January and asked for oversight, accountability and for him to access my bank accounts (we‚Äôve been friends for many years). I was terrified of myself and my future. I was literally scared. I could barely work. I DID NOT TRUST MYSELF. And rightly so, pretty promptly I started gambling again. I would take extra money out when I grocery shopped. I had no desire to stop, not really, not deep in my heart and to my bones. I liked it. In fact I loved it, I loved gambling! So I relieved my CPA of his duties and continued to gamble thru-out 2019. Big wins, big losses. 

And then? As 2020 approached I simply felt exhausted with it all. I became very tired of it. 
***I wanted a different life***. I WANTED TO STOP. I had no fear of myself. I accepted the enormous financial losses, I accepted myself and my gambling disease, I accepted my life as it is, with all of its loss and pain it‚Äôs dished out and all my urges evaporated. Gone. I feel like a different person. I have never had this kind of feeling in my gambling life before and admittedly I‚Äôm quite new to being clean, my last gamble was New Years Eve. I won about $2000 in less than half an hour, I cashed out my winnings for a change and walked out. I felt completely detached from the casino. It was no longer my friend (never was) and I didn‚Äôt trust it. I still don‚Äôt and never will. 

I then found this site, recalling that my CPA said to check online for gambling support groups since I didn‚Äôt really care for GA meetings. Even tho I feel no urges I still ordered a gambling workbook and disclosed my gambling problem to a family member and a small group of friends. All are very supportive. 

I know first-hand the trickery that lies in gambling and telling myself I‚Äôll only gamble ‚Äúfor a bit‚Äù or ‚Äújust a little‚Äù. I have left a casino after a nite of gambling and had to go directly to work, being totally disoriented by the sunlight and coming out of a gambling fog. I have asked to have my machine held while I ran home to feed the dogs and change shirts after 12-13 hours at the casino. Insane. I could go on and on. It‚Äôs over now. I do not want that life. And .. that is what‚Äôs different .. I simply no longer want a casino / gambling lifestyle. My peace of mind, mental health and financial stability have become critical for me and outweigh the so-called pleasure of gambling. I just want a different life now. I‚Äôm facing myself.  All of me ... and all of my hurts and disappointments. No escaping. I now readily admit that I have a disease. Gambling is not just a problem for me. I am sick. It is remission that I am seeking for this disorder. It is an illness I will carry till I take my last breath. 

It has been the acceptance of all of this that has removed my own fear of myself. I am no longer running scared and terrified of what I might do. I kid you not, I have never felt more at peace with myself since this ‚Äúacceptance phase‚Äù. For lack of better words, I royally f****d up due to a DISEASE. I would not condemn myself if I had cancer. I would get help for it. FULLY accepting that I had cancer may take some time tho. Just like it has with gambling. 

I don‚Äôt rule GA out these days and may return very soon. I‚Äôm definitely going to participate in a Skype gambling group as well that I heard about here. I put $100 into my savings account the other day. Much of what I had is gone money wise but why not start to rebuild I figured. I haven‚Äôt saved a dime since I can remember. Little by little...  

I don‚Äôt know if any of this helped anyone but please know it has helped me. THANK YOU if you have read this far, I know this is a very long post, I just really needed to get this out. I love that we are not alone here. Hate that we‚Äôre here but we are. So it‚Äôs incredibly helpful to talk to others who completely understand. I know the terrifying fear of what will become of our lives if we don‚Äôt ‚Äúget it together‚Äù. I‚Äôve also learned thru many stop / starts with gambling that it is so much deeper than that. We get SOOOO out of control with our gambling don‚Äôt we... Sigh. 

I now fully accept this sickness, ‚Äúmy sickness‚Äù, and that is the one thing I had never done until January 1st. Thank you all so much for the things you discuss here, you are all helping me with my recovery."

I've ruined my life immensely.

I am a young adult in the Tri State Area, newly out of college. Already don't like what I do enough, now the fact I have no money sucks. Make about 70k annually prior to taxes. Should increase to about 75k in June. Take home pay is roughly 2.1k semi monthly. I have nowhere to turn and every night I go to bed hating my life.  
Yes it's my fault, I'm the one who places the bets it is all my fault.   
I have been gambling since freshman year of college when I got introduced to it, immediately hooked. Been sports betting ever since, I remember up late at night scared as shit as to how was I going to pay off $500 to my bookie, I would trade anything to be able to go back to that point in my life and change it. The numbers have only gotten worse.  
I am so heavily involved in betting that everyone I know does it, I can't escape it.   


I came clean to my parents in the Fall of 2019 after I was down about 18k, they helped pay off half of it and took control over my bank account, I made it about 2 weeks and then went back into it. Showed them statement that had proof I was paying off my CC, which I was, only recently did I dip back into it to pay off bookies.   


I feel so hopeless, I get pressed every day for the money by the bookies, I don't think they would do anything physical but I stay at home every night in my room so I don't run the risk of seeing anyone, consistently lying I'm not in the area.  


My girlfriend broke up with me after I came clean to her in the fall, really put a toll on me, had really dark and extremely depressing thoughts after. I've tried going to therapy (Not GA) just therapy twice now, doesn't seem to be working. I am a nice guy, I've never taken out anger from losing on others, just myself internally, I'm just a young adult with a severe problem. I just don't know what the hell to do about the $. I got denied from loan places because my credit card was in bad shape etc.   


Some of the bookies are very loose friends too so I'm worried that it might get out how much I'm down, who the hell would wanna date a loser like me, let alone be friends. I feel so damn hopeless every day of my life, its hurting me at work as im not performing as well and I want to cry every moment of the day. I've had very dark and depressing thoughts creep into my brain and I need to fix my life.   


I know people have lost more but 50,000 is a ton of money and when you put it into years of time, its about a year of no spending a single dollar post taxes, which isn't realistic, I'm so sad and beat up all the time, if you read this far I thank you and encourage you to please respond.  


P.S: Addictions do run in my family if that adds any help  
P.S.S: Most days I've quit at a time was 183 in the summer of 2016. If I stopped betting after my parents bailed me out the first time in Fall of 2019, everything would be paid off by now and I would be enjoying life."
