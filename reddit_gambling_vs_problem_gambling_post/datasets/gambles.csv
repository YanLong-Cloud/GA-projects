gambling,"So I had a very weird experience on two bonus teases I have never seen before. I was playing the Zhao Ci variant at my local casino, and as per usual got the four ball tease with center ball flying by. What was interesting was that even though I didn't land it, the medium bonus ball went by. The second time I got a tease, the Large bonus ball went by. In the center spot. Which is impossible. 

Now the reason this perplexed me, was that supposedly (at least as far as I know) it is impossible for this to land in the center spot on the board. For those that don't play, those named balls are the progressives, and the center ball is the multiplier space. But there it was, twice. As a tease. 

To clarify this was an older variant, not a new dual center space variant where it supposedly is possible to land a progressive there. 

So my question to anyone who has played this more than me is, is it possible to land a progressive in the center? If so, is it possible to multiply it. 

And if not, why in God's name tease it?

gambling,"Today I started with 10 euro in Blackjack and ended up with 1000 euros. I lost 400 euros the other day, and I am a poor student so that was not good. I decided to stop. An today I tried just 10 euro more. And got lucky. Was at 700 at a point and then I started playing with my emotions I went as low as 300 euros again. But I made it back up to a 1000 and luckily i stopped. This was a good day. But it's important to stop. I think I will stop gambling for a while now and enjoy my money.

gambling,"So, yesterday, I received an email notifying me that my account had been suspended. I emailed customer service listed on the website, and they asked me to call their phone number, which I also verified on the website.

Customer service said a deposit had been reversed back in Nov., and I now owe them $250. While on the phone, I looked up the bank account in question from Nov. through today, and I had not received any money back at any point (from anyone). 

The woman told me I'd have to submit my bank statements from Nov. through the current date to resolve the issue to prove I hadn't received money back from the transaction. I told her under no circumstances would I provide them full bank statements. She then said they would send my account to a third party collection agency and it would hurt my credit. I told her if those are the only two options, I'd take the latter. I have a credit score over 800 and will fight it all the way.

gambling,"This took me about 6 hours total to brainstorm, write, revise. I created it for a bachelor party/vacation happening in 2 months. It can be setup with just pen and paper. I'm planning to involve real money. Any number of players can play. I didn't look up whether any similar games are out there because this was not made for commercialization purposes. My favorite part about this game, the reason I thought it's worth sharing, is that it's both simple and realistic, which makes it easy and fun, but you can also learn something. Looking forward to any reactions or advice, so I am X-posting here, although I already posted on r/boardgames

2 resources available: 1 / Time. 2 / Money. Everyone starts with 100 Time and 100 Money. If Time goes to 0, player is out and cannot communicate in any way with the remaining players.

I am planning to give real money as a prize, proportional to how much game money you end the game with. Another option is to let players start with different amounts of money depending on buy in amount.

2 actions that can be made at any time: 1 / Make law. 2 / Enforce law.

Laws can be made at anytime. Your laws can say whatever you want. You can write them down, or you can state them verbally. Your laws can also be used to trade Time and Money resources with other players. To finalize the time and money exchange that you made in your law, the involved parties can simultaneously enforce/allow the law, and the time and money are instantly remitted.

If an Enforce Law action is not coming from a mutual agreement between two parties, the Enforcement Phase begins. There is a continuous time decay rate of 1 Time per minute that the enforcement phase goes on, for all those players involved in the enforcement phase, which is the enforcer and the enforcee(s). The enforcer is responsible for keeping track of the time decay. Enforcer cannot enforce again on the same player until end of Enforcement Phase to cause more Time decay, but enforcer can alter the law that is being enforced.

2 actions that can be made by enforcee(s): 1 / Resist Law. 2 / Allow Law

After someone enforces law, enforcee can choose to resist law or allow law. If enforcee allows law, the enforcement phase ends instantly and all the contents of the law are enacted. The law could be something like, ""The Establishment of a New Country Named Happy Land"", which doesn't really help/hurt anyone, so it's unlikely to need to be enforced or resisted. Or it can be something like ""All players will pay a $10 tax to me"", which deducts prize money from the enforcees.

If enforcee resists law, enforcement phase continues. Time Decay is continuously subtracted during enforcement phase, but the time deductions caused by the following actions are only subtracted at the end of the enforcement phase.

Enforcer chooses to either 1 / Attack or 2 / Retreat.

If enforcer retreats, enforcement phase ends, and the law is not enforced on enforcee.

If enforcer decides to attack, enforcer chooses an amount of time to subtract from the enforcee, and that amount multiplied by 5/4 is subtracted from Enforcer. Once attack time is chosen, it cannot be changed and attack action is over. After enforcer decides on the Attack Time, the total elapsed time decay from the start of the enforcement phase to present is checked. If the enforcement phase time decay is greater than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase ends, the law is not enforced, and the attack time deduction is deducted. If the enforcement phase time decay is lower than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase continues.

Next, Enforcee may choose to do a Retaliate action. If the enforcement phase time decay becomes equal to the Attack Time at any point before the end of retaliation, the law is not enforced, and the respective attack action time deductions are deducted.

For a Retaliate Action, the Enforcee chooses an amount of time less than or equal to the amount that the Enforcer chose during the Attack action, and that amount is subtracted equally from both the enforcer and the enforcee. Once a retaliate action time deduction is chosen, it is final, and the enforcement phase is over.

Enforcement phase and the resulting continuous time decay can only end after Enforcee chooses their retaliation action. After the retaliation action is chosen, which is the end of the enforcement phase, time is deducted in the order of Attack Action time loss and then Retaliation Action time loss. Enforcement phase time decay ceases.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 Time, enforcee only gets time deduction equal to 4/5 of enforcer time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement fails and enforcee can choose to automatically make and enforce any law on enforcer and enforcer is out, so enforcer cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 time, but the enforcee time deduction is equal to enforcer time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 Time, enforcer only gets time deduction equal to 5/4 of enforcee time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement is successful and law can be revised by enforcer before final enforcement and enforcee is out, so enforcee cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 time, but the enforcer time deduction is equal to enforcee time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

The beautiful thing about this game is that you might never have to enter an enforcement phase and go through all the resultant complexity. The game has a chance of just being a role playing game of making funny, nonsensical, or inconsequential laws that have mutual agreement and never have to be enforced. But when real money is involved, you might want to use the enforcement phase to settle conflicts. The enforcement phase is the most difficult to understand and play, but it is not meant to be the central part of the game. The game is supposed to be about imagining that you are a GeoPolitical figure/country and how you might interact with the other figures.

Every couple months I put money on William hill to bet on sports. I (always despite my better judgement) end up playing blackjack and losing it all in 15 minutes. Cycle repeats every few months. Stupid of me to even go near it. I usually only play 30 hands give or take, and it always leads to an unreal losing streak. I really do think their blackjack is rigged.  The last 3 times I've played for example,  I have had 15 losses in 16 hands, the next time I put money on, a 7 hand losing streak, now again another 7 game losing streak, mixed with other bs in only 21 hands.  And I am pretty much playing it by the book. So my question: is this just outrageously bad luck or is something likely rotten in the state of Denmark?  

I could see this happening once, maybe twice, but 3 times in a row, call me skeptical.

Following the rules, you should hit again, right? But I‚Äôve always felt uneasy about that since if you just got two low cards, chances are the next card will be a higher card. But I know that that only really applies when there‚Äôs a set number of decks. In online blackjack, aren‚Äôt there unlimited cards, so those odds don‚Äôt really apply?

But I'm curious about potential comps along the way. I know you should never play specifically for comps and never expect anything. But I enjoy the hunt and the game for trying to maximize it. If I play a lot, but spaced out across Caesars properties, does that give worse comps than concentrating my play at one property, even if it's a slightly lower amount?

For example, video poker is one of my favorite games. At the level I want to play, Cromwell has better pay tables than Harrah's. Hypothetically, for a session, if I was gonna play $300-400 coin in Cromwell and nothing else, or $200-300 at Harrah's but plenty of table game play, which is better?

gambling," 

Hey Guys, so this is pretty embarrassing, but I have a very specific question, I'm hoping someone might have some advice or knowledge about it.

So to pass time, I play this stupid mobile slot machine game called Double Win. You get free ""coins"" every so often that you can use to play the slot machines. You can also buy coins with real money for a price.

The cost for these fake coins is roughly $100 for 2,250,000,000 coins.

I've been playing this off and on for many months, maybe even over a year off and on, just something to do for a few minutes when I get free coins, and then I stop when I'm out of coins and wait until I receive the next bonus.

I recently hit a major jackpot on one of the slots and won 1,424,286,075,157 coins.

If you do the math, the amount of coins I have is worth $66,301 in real money if you were to buy that same amount of coins from the applications store.

I'm wondering if there is a way I can sell my account to someone at a major discount to make some money. It looks like there is a User ID tied to my account.

I'd bet that there's someone that would want a trillion coins for the game at a major discount.

Players can partake in games like Death Rolls, Blackjack and Roulette with the help of the in-game random number generator. (Numbers are generated by typing /roll followed by the number.  A coin flip is ""/roll 2"". A dice roll is ""/roll 6"". Most games are played with /roll 100.) 

Death Rolls - A player (usually the house) will start with a /roll 100. The opponent will then /roll the result of the previous roll. This process goes back and forth, getting smaller and smaller, until a player rolls a 1 and loses.

An example might look like this:

High/Low - Each player will /roll 100. The player with the highest result wins the game. Ties are re-rolled.

Roulette - A player makes bets and receives payouts exactly like in the real world Roulette. The house will /roll 38. 37 is 0 and 38 is 00.

Blackjack - The rules are the same as in normal Blackjack, but there's no splitting. Using a /roll 13, the house gets 1 number and the player gets two. 1 = Ace. 2-10 = given value. 11-13 = 10 . The player then has to Hit, Stand, or Double. (Surrender may or may not be available depending on the Casino) The house then does a /roll 13 to get their second card, add up the value and continue to ""draw"" cards until they hit 17 or bust.

Lucky 100 - The player will /roll 100. If the number is 1-60, the player loses. If the number is 61-97, the player wins double their wager. If the number is 98, 99, or 100, you win triple. 

There are numerous versions of Lucky 100. The numbers and payouts tend to vary slightly depending on which casino you go to. 

Do any of these games have +EV? I have a small nest egg saved that I'd like to grow in a fun way.

You place a bet for ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, if it wins you get ¬£110 (¬£10 profit). You lay a bet on the same outcome, ¬£105 at odds of 1 (EVEN)

If the horse wins, you win ¬£110 from the bet, but lose the lay bet, paying ¬£105. Profit = ¬£5

If the horse loses, you keep the lay bet of ¬£105, but lost the ¬£100 bet. Profit = ¬£5

If you enter this into any of the online calculators, it says that if you are betting ¬£100 at odds of 1.1, then you should lay ¬£110 at odds of 1 to guarantee ¬£10 profit. Surely they are not taking into account the fact that if the horse wins, you would have made ¬£10 profit from the bet getting ¬£110 back, but that you would have also paid out ¬£110 for the lay bet.

What I really liked was how many roulette games have a stat board with the last 20-30 game results, so we looked for tables that hadn't hit green in a while and then went in on 0 and 00.

So I end up winning $470 off 2 greens (0 and 00) in quick succession and decide to hit the real table.

I decided I didn't like that table and got up and walked down towards where the boss with my ID was. He was on the computer with 4-5 other casino employees/dealers around.

Used the welcome bonus with no cash out restriction to boost my $25 amount to a little under a $100, with 30x playthrough and only able to play slots.  Played Santastic, Shark School ,Cash Bandits 2 and a few spins of Count Spectacular.  Last night when i went to bed I had a little over $9,000.

Essentially, I hit the progressive on Santastic twice in 1 night (.50 cent bet) and was able to grind my way through the roughly $3600 play through, ending up with something around $700.  After the entire amount (minus the bonus portion they deduct) became unlocked and the money was unrestricted, I increased my stakes gradually and also added in craps doing Pass Line with Come bets and got particularly lucky along with higher stakes slots on my 3 favorites listed above...

Craps on RTG is highly volatile and you will never go more than 10-15 spins before a 7 out.  Anywho, after grinding about 20 hours over a week over these games I have now won the most I've ever won.  (Previous high was Dover Downs in Delaware, $7000 playing Craps and Blackjack and hitting the side bet bonuses).

I have already submitted my verification documentation 3 days ago (they ask for many things) and awaiting approval, which says typically 4 business days.  They have a maximum cashout of $2000 per week with a 7 business day period processing for each one and also have a stipulation in their T&amp;C that they reserve the right to pay in installments, so I might be collecting for several months (by reading some of the reviews on Bovegas).  I'm hopeful they will pay out my winnings without too much resistance.

I was playing the Zhao Ci variant at my local casino, and as per usual got the four ball tease with center ball flying by. What was interesting was that even though I didn't land it, the medium bonus ball went by. The second time I got a tease, the Large bonus ball went by. In the center spot. Which is impossible. 

Now the reason this perplexed me, was that supposedly (at least as far as I know) it is impossible for this to land in the center spot on the board. For those that don't play, those named balls are the progressives, and the center ball is the multiplier space. But there it was, twice. As a tease. 

To clarify this was an older variant, not a new dual center space variant where it supposedly is possible to land a progressive there. 

So my question to anyone who has played this more than me is, is it possible to land a progressive in the center? If so, is it possible to multiply it.

I am planning to give real money as a prize, proportional to how much game money you end the game with. Another option is to let players start with different amounts of money depending on buy in amount.

2 actions that can be made at any time: 1 / Make law. 2 / Enforce law.

Laws can be made at anytime. Your laws can say whatever you want. You can write them down, or you can state them verbally. Your laws can also be used to trade Time and Money resources with other players. To finalize the time and money exchange that you made in your law, the involved parties can simultaneously enforce/allow the law, and the time and money are instantly remitted.

If an Enforce Law action is not coming from a mutual agreement between two parties, the Enforcement Phase begins. There is a continuous time decay rate of 1 Time per minute that the enforcement phase goes on, for all those players involved in the enforcement phase, which is the enforcer and the enforcee(s). The enforcer is responsible for keeping track of the time decay. Enforcer cannot enforce again on the same player until end of Enforcement Phase to cause more Time decay, but enforcer can alter the law that is being enforced.

2 actions that can be made by enforcee(s): 1 / Resist Law. 2 / Allow Law

After someone enforces law, enforcee can choose to resist law or allow law. If enforcee allows law, the enforcement phase ends instantly and all the contents of the law are enacted. The law could be something like, ""The Establishment of a New Country Named Happy Land"", which doesn't really help/hurt anyone, so it's unlikely to need to be enforced or resisted. Or it can be something like ""All players will pay a $10 tax to me"", which deducts prize money from the enforcees.

If enforcee resists law, enforcement phase continues. Time Decay is continuously subtracted during enforcement phase, but the time deductions caused by the following actions are only subtracted at the end of the enforcement phase.

Enforcer chooses to either 1 / Attack or 2 / Retreat.

If enforcer retreats, enforcement phase ends, and the law is not enforced on enforcee.

If enforcer decides to attack, enforcer chooses an amount of time to subtract from the enforcee, and that amount multiplied by 5/4 is subtracted from Enforcer. Once attack time is chosen, it cannot be changed and attack action is over. After enforcer decides on the Attack Time, the total elapsed time decay from the start of the enforcement phase to present is checked. If the enforcement phase time decay is greater than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase ends, the law is not enforced, and the attack time deduction is deducted. If the enforcement phase time decay is lower than the Attack Time, the enforcement phase continues.

Next, Enforcee may choose to do a Retaliate action. If the enforcement phase time decay becomes equal to the Attack Time at any point before the end of retaliation, the law is not enforced, and the respective attack action time deductions are deducted.

For a Retaliate Action, the Enforcee chooses an amount of time less than or equal to the amount that the Enforcer chose during the Attack action, and that amount is subtracted equally from both the enforcer and the enforcee. Once a retaliate action time deduction is chosen, it is final, and the enforcement phase is over.

Enforcement phase and the resulting continuous time decay can only end after Enforcee chooses their retaliation action. After the retaliation action is chosen, which is the end of the enforcement phase, time is deducted in the order of Attack Action time loss and then Retaliation Action time loss. Enforcement phase time decay ceases.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 Time, enforcee only gets time deduction equal to 4/5 of enforcer time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement fails and enforcee can choose to automatically make and enforce any law on enforcer and enforcer is out, so enforcer cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcer to go to 0 time, but the enforcee time deduction is equal to enforcer time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

If attack action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 Time, enforcer only gets time deduction equal to 5/4 of enforcee time remaining before attack action time deduction and enforcement is successful and law can be revised by enforcer before final enforcement and enforcee is out, so enforcee cannot communicate with other players anymore. Almost same deal if retaliation action time deduction causes enforcee to go to 0 time, but the enforcer time deduction is equal to enforcee time remaining before retaliation action time deduction.

The beautiful thing about this game is that you might never have to enter an enforcement phase and go through all the resultant complexity. The game has a chance of just being a role playing game of making funny, nonsensical, or inconsequential laws that have mutual agreement and never have to be enforced. But when real money is involved, you might want to use the enforcement phase to settle conflicts. The enforcement phase is the most difficult to understand and play, but it is not meant to be the central part of the game. The game is supposed to be about imagining that you are a GeoPolitical figure/country and how you might interact with the other figures.

Every couple months I put money on William hill to bet on sports. I (always despite my better judgement) end up playing blackjack and losing it all in 15 minutes. Cycle repeats every few months. Stupid of me to even go near it. I usually only play 30 hands give or take, and it always leads to an unreal losing streak. I really do think their blackjack is rigged.  The last 3 times I've played for example,  I have had 15 losses in 16 hands, the next time I put money on, a 7 hand losing streak, now again another 7 game losing streak, mixed with other bs in only 21 hands.  And I am pretty much playing it by the book. So my question: is this just outrageously bad luck or is something likely rotten in the state of Denmark?  

I could see this happening once, maybe twice, but 3 times in a row, call me skeptical.

Hey Guys, so this is pretty embarrassing, but I have a very specific question, I'm hoping someone might have some advice or knowledge about it.

So to pass time, I play this stupid mobile slot machine game called Double Win. You get free ""coins"" every so often that you can use to play the slot machines. You can also buy coins with real money for a price.

The cost for these fake coins is roughly $100 for 2,250,000,000 coins.

I've been playing this off and on for many months, maybe even over a year off and on, just something to do for a few minutes when I get free coins, and then I stop when I'm out of coins and wait until I receive the next bonus.

I recently hit a major jackpot on one of the slots and won 1,424,286,075,157 coins.

If you do the math, the amount of coins I have is worth $66,301 in real money if you were to buy that same amount of coins from the applications store.

I'm wondering if there is a way I can sell my account to someone at a major discount to make some money. It looks like there is a User ID tied to my account.

Death Rolls - A player (usually the house) will start with a /roll 100. The opponent will then /roll the result of the previous roll. This process goes back and forth, getting smaller and smaller, until a player rolls a 1 and loses.

An example might look like this: 

A. /roll 100 = 83
B. /roll 83   = 42
A. /roll 42   = 13
B. /roll 13   = 7
A. /roll 7     = 1

High/Low - Each player will /roll 100. The player with the highest result wins the game. Ties are re-rolled.

Roulette - A player makes bets and receives payouts exactly like in the real world Roulette. The house will /roll 38. 37 is 0 and 38 is 00.

Blackjack - The rules are the same as in normal Blackjack, but there's no splitting. Using a /roll 13, the house gets 1 number and the player gets two. 1 = Ace. 2-10 = given value. 11-13 = 10 . The player then has to Hit, Stand, or Double. (Surrender may or may not be available depending on the Casino) The house then does a /roll 13 to get their second card, add up the value and continue to ""draw"" cards until they hit 17 or bust.

Lucky 100 - The player will /roll 100. If the number is 1-60, the player loses. If the number is 61-97, the player wins double their wager. If the number is 98, 99, or 100, you win triple. 

There are numerous versions of Lucky 100. The numbers and payouts tend to vary slightly depending on which casino you go to.

     I plan on taking a trip to AC at some point in 2020 as I‚Äôve never been, and I‚Äôd like to take my fianc√© as kind of a ‚Äúgetaway‚Äù. We both like to gamble but we‚Äôre very reasonable with it, we have 1 ‚Äúlocal‚Äù casino (Hollywood Casino at Penn national Raceway) and it‚Äôs only 30 minutes away and we still only only go once every three or four months, and we typically take relatively small amounts ($200 for her for slots and depending on what I do I take $200-$500) but when we go to AC I‚Äôd like to take a lot more, say $1000-$1500 each, the only way for me to justify this financially is if I can find a stupid cheap room or even talk my way into a comp. now I‚Äôm not expecting a borgata top floor suite, really anything will do, but what are my best options as far as pricing and timing of the trip (location isn‚Äôt a big deal as I‚Äôll be driving there, so I‚Äôll have a car). I have no clue what the ‚Äúoff season‚Äù for AC is and I‚Äôd imagine I can get some decent info from all the experienced gamblers here.

Also, where should I play to build up rewards points the fastest or just the best rewards systems in general as I‚Äôll likely be back

Thank you to everyone in advance

Ps - I know this was lengthy for a simple question, and yes I know it‚Äôs not a lot of money to make a trip of it but AC is like 4 hours from me so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm flying 6 hours to Vegas with $2500, also I‚Äôm typically very frugal, so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the budget lol",Best time/place for comped rooms?
gambling,"I just left a strip casino after a big hit and cashed out $80k in chips.

The cashier counted it as $90k and called for a double-count. Her double said looks good and they proceeded to hand me $10k more than they were supposed to.

-Are the black/red gambles always a genuine 50/50? 
-if you vary your bets....can betting large at the right time pay off? Or does the machine simply adjust the win to retain its pay out rate

gambling,"Since many years now I had a tendancy to play poker and BJ 20$ bucks here and there just for fun. Sometimes I felt like gambling more like 100$ and that was it. I ALWAYS ended up losing everything in a week or so. I did'nt really care tbh, it was fun while it lasted for me. The pattern was about every 6 months or so I would jump in. But everytime I would lose everything I had by that strong feeling to gain it all back whenever I lose. 

Even though it was never BIG BETS, still, overtime it adds up quite a bit and I decided to lifetime self exclude myself(if possible) from one site. Then I would find another site to play, and I did self excluse myself to pretty much all the major websites of gambling and poker.

We played blackjack downtown at El Cortez. Really good tables with $10 minimums. You can count it easy enough but don't overstay your welcome or they'll back you off. I typically will count for 1 hour and then leave and have never had a problem. El Cortez had a large bucket filled with ice and beer right by the tables so beer drink service is good.

We played Pai Gow downtown at Golden Nugget. The jackpot is a $1 bet and it's over 500k right now. It's a $15 minimum table. Drink service is slower than El Cortez but not horrible.

Craps and Pai Gow tiles we played at Bellagio. $25 tables. We got destroyed at craps quickly but played for hours at tiles and broke even. Drink service is excellent at Bellagio. 

We played roulette at Cromwell. They have a $25 minimum single zero roulette which is the cheapest single zero I could find. Didn't drink here.  They also look like they had playable blackjack but I didn't have time.

Over-Under of the Falcons-49ers game was 48 points. 49ers lead 22-17 with 10 seconds left (39 points).

Falcons score a touchdown with 2 seconds left to take the lead 23-22. They elect not to kick the extra point and just kneel down to prevent any potential blocked kick return (45 points, still under 48).

Falcons still have to kick back to the 49ers for one final play. 49ers take the kick, and start frantically passing the ball backwards to each other to keep the play alive in hopes of scoring. However, the 49ers fumble on the 3 yard line, the Falcons recover, and fall into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game. 29-22, with the total now 51.

gambling,"I just felt like sharing with someone.. I've been gambling for 18 years (the bodog and poker era) and about a week ago I saw an ad for Bovegas accepting USA players online.  I normally gamble in the local casinos (we have many here) and decided to give it a go.  Used the welcome bonus with no cash out restriction to boost my $25 amount to a little under a $100, with 30x playthrough and only able to play slots.  Played Santastic, Shark School ,Cash Bandits 2 and a few spins of Count Spectacular.  Last night when i went to bed I had a little over $9,000. My comp points show I have done about $40,000 of play through.

Essentially, I hit the progressive on Santastic twice in 1 night (.50 cent bet) and was able to grind my way through the roughly $3600 play through, ending up with something around $700.  After the entire amount (minus the bonus portion they deduct) became unlocked and the money was unrestricted, I increased my stakes gradually and also added in craps doing Pass Line with Come bets and got particularly lucky along with higher stakes slots on my 3 favorites listed above... Literally a heater, I was getting bonus round after bonus, increasing my stakes eventually to $5/$6 per spin.

Craps on RTG is highly volatile and you will never go more than 10-15 spins before a 7 out.  Anywho, after grinding about 20 hours over a week over these games I have now won the most I've ever won.  (Previous high was Dover Downs in Delaware, $7000 playing Craps and Blackjack and hitting the side bet bonuses).

I have already submitted my verification documentation 3 days ago (they ask for many things) and awaiting approval, which says typically 4 business days.  They have a maximum cashout of $2000 per week with a 7 business day period processing for each one and also have a stipulation in their T&amp;C that they reserve the right to pay in installments, so I might be collecting for several months (by reading some of the reviews on Bovegas).  I'm hopeful they will pay out my winnings without too much resistance.
